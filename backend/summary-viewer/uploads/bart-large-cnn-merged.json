In contrast other countries with different voting systems often have in between four and seven more or less relevant parties in parliament at any given time. Why the two party system is bad for public discourse In most countries there is at least one moderate and one more hard leaning party on each side of the political spectrum which allows voters to differentiate between centrist and more extreme positions with their voting bill. Contrary to that in America every right leaning position on the spectrum all the way from alt righ white supremacists down to mostly undecided between the parties but slightly more right are all condensed into the GOP while all left leaning positions are part of the democrats. As a result if a voter decides to vote against the alt right he has to vote democrat and is essentially supporting SJWs and Antifa because those people also vote democrats. This influences political oppinions and discussion in America in a really harmful and undesirable way. For example here in Germany where I live if extremists are doing their typical bullshit, whether it's neo nazis attacking someone or the recent Antifa riots during the G20 summit the first thought on almost everyones mind is fucking extremists . In contrast if I look at the reaction to the Charlotteville incident in the US the first thought on most democrats minds seems to be fucking right wing mindset while many republicans seem to think Shit I have to distract from the fact that these people are on my side. Also I have to remind everyone that Antifa and BLM are just as bad so no one starts voting democrats over this. The exact same thing in reverse happened last year when SJWs physically attacked Trump supporters on a university campus. In that back then most Republicans were on about how this shows that democrats are hypocrites while some democrats and even some major democrat media were actually trying to find excuses for those actions. In addition political discussions in the US are far more charged, hate filled and centred arround a partisan us vs them mentality than those in central Europe and I can't help but feel like unless the US reform their voting system to allow for more parties this is not going to change. gt This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

English prejudice against foreigners The word \u201cracism\u201d as I see it, is an umbrella term for anything that fits within the above definition. \u201cInstitutionalized racism\u201d would therefore be under the umbrella of \u201cracism\u201d. To redefine the umbrella term \u201cracism\u201d as prejudice the power to enforce said prejudice, is counter productive in communication. Critical Race Theory CRT does indeed deviate from the principles of colorblindness but that is not my point of contention. If one needed to describe the racism that has been built into the fundamental structure of things, then institutionalized racism serves the purpose. If one wants to describe prejudice power, then instead of redefining lay term \u201cracism\u201d one ought to develop a new or compounded term to serve that specific purpose. When focusing in on specifics one ought to be specific not less. I do understand that the terms \u201cracism\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d are not sophisticated enough to describe everything that must necessarily be discussed. Lets look at an example to illustrate that. \u201cA black man has experienced racism from white people his whole life. He does not believe that white people or black people are superior to one another, but he does indeed bear mistrust and anger towards white people as a whole due to his life experiences. \u201c Clearly the terms \u201cprejudiced\u201d or \u201cracist\u201d do not describe the above example. This certainly calls for a new word or combination of words. Instead of doing that, however, what I am seeing is the redefinition of the umbrella term. This has caused no small amount of confusion and argument in the efforts of CRT scholars in their attempts to generate a race conscious society. If the goal of CRT scholars and the groups that use this theory is to generate race consciousness and move away from the prior ideals of colorblindness, then crystal clear communication is essential. I have personally witnessed close friends arguing over what the word \u201cracist\u201d means, when what they could have been discussing might have been issues of race consciousness and ways of furthering that goal at large and in ones daily life. Passive oppression should be confronted with clear terms and parameters, and it is counter productive to try and redefine a very general term when more specific terms can accurately described what you are trying to communicate. I have also seen an additional negative impact as well. I have seen people using the CRT definition of racism to claim that they can not possibly be \u201cracist\u201d as they were black and not part of the white majority who hold prejudice power . While based on their newfound definition, this was true, to their audience they sounded entirely mad. Furthermore if one does redefine the term \u201cracist\u201d, what term are they inserting in its place? If racism no longer means racism, the term prejudice can not be shoehorned into its place. You still need to invent a new word or combination of words to fill that void. The word \u201cracist\u201d in its non CRT definition is still useful in a great many situations and can not merely be abandoned. Essentially we either need to use \u201cracism\u201d as an umbrella term and have more specific definitions within it, or if we are to redefine \u201cracism\u201d, we need to invent a new word to take its place. Either way we still have the same problem of needing a new word. So, there is my view. Am I wrong? If so, please change my view or show me what I am missing in my understanding.

It has no concrete effect on your life whether or not you persuade a random person on the internet that, for example, abortion should or should not be permissible.

First, the internet is a public place where other people are watching, and the person you're having the discussion with doesn't want to look like a fool in front of the other people on his side of the debate. He will look for any tiny little unclarity or weak point in your position, and even if he can't find one, he will attack something perfectly reasonable to avoid conceding the argument. Second, if you're debating anything substantial and your position is actually justified, you hold your position for a complicated set of reasons that you cannot convey in an internet post of reasonable size.

Let me explain If I am a taxpaying homeowner, and let's say I dislike Jews to pick a random ethnic minority . As a homeowner, I have the right to refuse Jewish people into my home. My home is mine. The same should qualify for a business. Let's say the CEO of Wal Mart just to pick a random company hates Jews. He hates them so much that he decides that he will not employ any Jewish people nor let them in the store. Why is it different for him to operate his business based on his own personal views and morals as it is for how he handles things at home? If the CEO of Wal Mart decided to do that, he would deal with some harsh consequences. For one, Jews would no longer shop at Wal Mart. Many non Jewish citizens would also stop shopping at Wal Mart because they found that practice to be despicable. Many companies would stop doing business with Wal Mart because of this practice. The companies that still did business with Wal Mart would lose most of the same clientele that have stopped supporting Wal Mart. Many other stores such as Target and K Mart would thrive on making the public aware that they do not have the hateful policies that Wal Mart has and would reach out to the customers alienated by Wal Marts policy. Eventually, the CEO of Wal Mart would decide to discontinue this practice. Why? Because the millions or possibly billions of lost revenue would convince him that having this practice is bad for business. I guarantee if Arizona had allowed their keep the gays away bill, that whichever businesses decided to exercise that right would lose substantial profits and their competitors would drive them out. We saw this happen with Chic fil A. It came out that they were funding anti gay groups, word got out, people protested and boycotted, and they eventually stopped giving to those groups. Did Dan Cathy have a sudden revelation that made him change his mind about gay people? No. He did it because it was in his economic interest. In a capitalist society, it is the responsibility of the consumer to support businesses you want to succeed based on your personal ethics. This is why I believe that anyone complaining about minimum wage but still shops at Wal Mart or eats at McDonald's is a complete hypocrite. I personally do not buy gas from Exxon due to their treatment of the LGBT community. As a consumer, your purchasing power is your vote. Put it to use. Ignorant, hateful people have rights to their beliefs just as everyone else does. If someone opens up a discriminatory business, there is a chance that they might be able to stay afloat from the patronage of equally hateful citizens or perhaps citizens that are just apathetic, but it would be a small number, and accepting, non discriminatory businesses would emerge to accommodate consumers that are more open minded. We saw a lot of right wing Christians support Chic fil A's decisions, but eventually, the company gave in. I think if a white supremacist wanted to open a whites only bar for fellow minded people to congregate then it should be his constitutional right. If a huge Dallas Cowboys fan wanted to open up a sports bar that is openly for the Cowboys and they didn't want any Redskins fans in the bar cheering for the other team, they should have the right to refuse them service. It's your business. Do what you want. Just as a secular government allows religious citizens, but does not make laws honoring religious beliefs. Our goal in a society should not be to force beliefs that are right, but instead learn to let all ideas co exist no matter how despicable or hateful they may seem as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others.

The US is a poor ally for the Kurds. They armed them and helped them, but only against IS because the Kurds abandoned oilfields of American companies in Northern Iraq. This forced Obama to intervene. But US has too much at stakes within Turkey airfields, nuclear weapon storages to effectively offer the Kurds any political support beyond weapons and airstrikes. They already are withdrawing support to Syrian Kurds after the Turkish Kurds broke the truce with Erdogan. Russians have bombed ISIS and the rebels, but haven't bombed the Kurds yet, and the Kurds and the regime, while not working together, have not been in open conflict. After the regime ran out of Hakasah, and IS took the former regime bases, the Kurds retook it, and the regime let them. They even had shared borders, and border patrols standing across each other warily, but no open conflict. Sometimes, they will even let them cross each other's territory to resupply move troops, etc. Source The Kurds don't also explicitily demand the removal of Assad. All they want is more autonomy and their own region. Both the regime and the Kurds fight IS. The Free Syrian Army has also allied itself with Is and Al Nusrah before against the Kurds, but IS turned on both, and drove them out. This makes for hostility between the Free Syrian Army and the Kurds, so a rebel Kurd alliance is unlikely. Rather, Russian diplomats will negotiate with the Kurds. In the following weeks, we will hear that Russians communicate with Kurds in context of airstrikes, etc. Russian special forces will, alongside with the US and the British who have vowed to send special OPS recently , assist the Kurds when they attack ISIS, alongside with airstrikes and materials given. Having the Kurds as an ally would expand Russian influence in the region significantly and Kurds are historically and ideologically friendly to Russia. Many Kurds are pro communism, and left in general. Military, first a map. the Kurds could push hard to the south to besiege Raqqah and cut off supplylines to Aleppo. Or the Kurds would simultaneously push West towards Aleppo or East from their little pocket to the North East , while the Regime would push North to Idlib and from there to Aleppo. The Kurds get Aleppo and Raqqa, while the regime pushes east. Kurds will pressure from the North, while the regime moves West. In Iraq, Iraqi Kurds could push South to further pressure IS. However, Iraqi Kurds and Syrian Kurds are not as close as the Syrian Kurds and the Turkish Kurds. This is important later on. Now, as for the population this is tricky. Some analysists say that moderate Sunii are not eager to support the Kurds, but rather to support IS instead who are Sunii However, I feel that most Sunii Syrians support the regime most of all, and support stability over all now. If Kurds would ally with the regime, and the Kurds could provide a stable enviroment and provide what the Syrian Sunii need, the Sunii would accept this. ISIS' barbaric acts made for their loss of support from moderate muslims. This will be vital. However, not all the local Arabic tribes will peacefully cooperate with Kurds. Unfortunetly, ethnic cleansings will might happen. After ISIS is largely driven back, a deal will be struck with the Kurds between the regime and the Kurds. In return for support, the Kurds will receive a region with greater autonomous rights in the North of Syria. Perhaps not all they gained would be allowed for them to keep, but still. Especially Russia would negotiate this with the regime and the Kurds, since if they have Kurdish support, they would have significant influence in the region to counteract Israel and to the North, Turkey. Now, even if Assad would be deposed Russians have recently changed stance to claim they never insisted on Assad staying in power , they'd have an ally. Most likely, we'd see a new puppet democracy where for example the Kurds would have a determined number of seats in Parliament, allowing them to block new legislation if this displeases the Russians or themselves.

For context, our baby girl just turned 6 months old. Many out there, including our pediatrician, believe that it is best to pierce the babies ears before she is old enough to understand the pain. Also, for full disclosure I actually love the idea of my daughter having earrings, just not before she wants them. But I simply cannot understand doing this to a baby and that's why I am here. Change my view. Literally everybody granted, a small sample size of around a dozen people I have spoken to says I should have my babies ears pierced, but I just can't get behind it. So let's forget about my baby, and just talk about babies in general. To start, baby girls What if a baby girl doesn't want her ears pierced when she is older? Why should the choice be made for her? They are tiny holes but they are still mostly permanent. Getting a shot injection is pain, but it provides a benefit. Who is to say that earring holes are a benefit? Certainly not the baby right? So, why would parents subject their baby to pain at all without a clear benefit? The logic is lost on me, entirely. Baby boys I know one couple that had their baby boy ears pierced. I'm not trying to start a gender debate here. But statistically speaking, most boys in the English speaking world do not wear earrings. So I have the same argument here as I do with girls, but even stronger statistics to back it up. Granted, I'm fine with boys getting earrings, but again it is when they want one several. tl dr I believe that piercing a babies ears takes away what could be an exciting decision they make for themselves, about themselves, early in life. It also subjects them to a small amount of discomfort for, what I believe, is no benefit. I am hopeful that the responses here will either change my view entirely, or make me hate the idea less.

I really wanted to come to reddit as a place for debate discussion. So recently I've come across some people complaining about tampon taxes. I won't link those articles because there's so many of them and can be found doing a simple search. I will link to everything else. Basically, the complaint is that disposable feminine hygiene products pads and tampons around the world has a SALES tax because they are considered non essential luxury items. You know, like pretty much everything else you buy. Certain items aren't taxed because they are considered necessary like baby food and fruit. Feminists and SJWs are all rallying to get rid of this sales tax completely and are arguing petitioning that these items are necessary and should be considered as such instead of luxury items . I disagree and I absolutely think that these disposable feminine hygiene products ARE luxury items. In fact, I think the taxes on them should be higher in order to discourage women from buying them. I also think that discouraging the purchase of these disposable items will be beneficial to the environment by reducing waste. Since 2000, Britain has set the tax on sanitary products at the lowest possible level of 5 percent. Many EU countries impose a tax of about 20 percent on tampons and sanitary pads. I'd like to introduce a brief history of how women dealt with their menstrual cycles when these products didn't exist. I'm not saying we revert back to those methods but I think it's worth noting that these women were crafty or didn't care. The fact that we have these items today make it more easily manageable, therefore it's a luxury. Just to provide perspective, it's comparable to walking somewhere vs. having a mode of transportation like a horse, bike, or vehicle, which are all luxuries. Egyptian, women used softened papyrus for tampons. Meanwhile, across the Mediterranean, Greeks rigged their tampons out of lint wrapped around small pieces of wood. Their Roman neighbors wore pads and tampons made of soft wool. In Germany and England in the 1800s, some women wore homemade pads but many didn\u2019t. In fact, it was the custom for rural women and women of lower classes to just bleed into their clothing In the early 1900s, American women made homemade pads out of the same absorbent cotton material used for baby diapers. Women pinned these pads to their underwear or homemade muslin belts. Sanitary aprons and bloomers became available by mail order. Tampons and pads didn't appear in the market until 1933 by Tampax. Here is some more menstrual history if you're interested. The average woman throws away approximately 100 150kg of \u201cfeminine hygiene products\u201d during her lifetime. This includes tampons, disposable pads, pantiliners, disposable menstrual cups, tampon applicators, and all the packaging that those products come in. A lot more waste comes from each sanitary item being individually wrapped in plastic and paper. These sanitary items, as well as disposable diapers, each take approximately 500 800 years to decompose. I couldn't find a good estimate on what an average woman spends on tampons so I did a little research myself. If the average woman menstruates for forty years and uses approximately 20 tampons per cycle 240 tampons each year , that's 9,600 in her entire menstrual life cycle. In today's current market, a box of the cheapest tampons at walmart are Equate 18 count at 2.77. 9600 tampons breaks down to 533.33 we'll say 534 18 count boxes of tampons per lifetime. thanks to a bit just for the correction . If you were to buy your lifetime supply of tampons for your entire menstrual life from today, you would spend approximately 1,479.18. If you bought it for the year, it would be approximately 38.78. Although I chose to use the cheapest brand, many girls tend to gravitate towards the namebrand products which can range from 6 12 per box of various counts.There are so many menstrual product alternatives which include reusable washable pads and menstrual cups as pad and tampon replacements, respectively.

However, when the gaming world took a turn for the multiplayer and the MMORPG, people started to become, at least in my view, more cynical, bitter, and paranoid about any new feature or hotfix. I've lost the last decade of my life in WoW, and oh my good guava, those people are more toxic than Cartman's Nagasaki Fart. Everything is always about arguing and negativity, either at the developers themselves or, barring anything to argue about, they EAT EACH OTHER.

My CMV is this Why is this a bad thing? In the past, you had Nintendo fanboys and Sega fanboys. You supported the system and its developer, and you generally bought products from them, trusting in the quality. Sometimes this was a good thing The Incredible Hulk would break every bone in his hands trying to bend a Game Boy Color , sometimes you got burned Dreamcast, you had such potential . The point is, fanboy was just a word to describe a preference in the console wars. It was never meant to be used as a derogatory term. As for white knighting, I think this is a good thing. Think about this from a developer standpoint. You release this game, or implement new features, or hotfix issues, and you turn to the forums or social media for input on how it was received, and comb through it for new and interesting ways to make it better or put in something fun and possible within development time. Now imagine all you ever see are people calling you out, calling for your whole company to fail, and sometimes just insulting you or telling you they quit every week over and over. It would discourage you from interacting with the community, right? White knights, as they are called, are not inherently bad, in my opinion. They can offer constructive criticism, they can point out the positives in the new content or game, they can express their love for the design or gameplay aspects. They can be a counter to all the negativity you see across every single multiplayer game out there LoL's community scares the hell out of me . When did it become a bad thing to actually ENJOY a game?

I believe it made me take it slightly easy in this area But here is my story please do not pity me, you'll see I'm not to be pitied I hope . I have cerebral palsy. A condition that effects my walking, talking and over all balance. On the bright side I never needed medication. At 23 I finished university. In the three years I spend in university I notice exactly how my disability effected me. I wasn't able to run. Was able to slowly walk up and down stairs. I was kind of hard to be understood in various situations. I'm an introvert. I have no problems entertaining myself. That along with all my speech problems, made making friends not worth the trouble. After university I was at a fork on the road. There was the career ladder or the health and self esteem ladder. I took the latter. So I stopped applying for jobs even the formal requirement of strong communication skills scared me to death and instead took up training. I made it a personal mission to improve my walking and my speech. The speech therapists were all gloom and doom I since found of that I might have simply seen a bad therapist , but with physical training I did it all myself. I went to the gym for two years or so, hated it it feels to me like the hamsters on the wheel but I was too weak and too scared of going out alone so training in nature was a no no. After the gym I started going out. First it felt as I assume a person with claustrophobia would feel in tight places. Being outside with endless opportunities to fall and be made fun of was terrifying. I did fall, I was made fun of but I simply walked around the house the most depressing thing ever Slowly I started going further and further away from my house When I first went to the heart of the city centre, the heart of market street, I was terrified. People were going in all directions and it felt as if they were all about to push me around. I did fall but not a big deal. The long and boring story short. I now jog for 10k. Now I love to get lost in jogging and I love it. When I started writing this I didn't plan to say so much but it is actually feeling good to let it out. Now, this year, since the start of august. I feel like a normal human being. I'm still introverted as hell but there are many of us out there, there's even a book that I think is called the power of introvert actually finally being able to say, FUCK NO, it's not because I'm disabled but because I'm an introvert it fucking feels amazing Now all that is behind me and my training has become a habit that I no longer need to push myself to do. I look at my life and say, Fuck, I have nothing in the eyes of sociaty I studied for web design and kept the skills up, but I'm 5 years behind work experience. My parents are amazing. I'm a low maintenance don't do drugs, alcohol and the state benefit I get goes entirely to the house income. I now want to work on my career and still want to live with my parents. They are cool, and I'm cool with them. My brother wanted to go off to college and both my parents expressed how much they'd want their baby boy to stay home for at least few more years. I would hate it if I was a burdan to them. I have had many frank conversations with them.

The Shape of Water plays on to the basic beauty and the beast trope, but it does not go any further than that. The movie weighs heavily on the cinematography and strays away from any actual plot or substance. It is an intermediate form of movie writing and does not deserve any more than a Redbox rental. The movie barely dives into the actual underlying foundation for why anything happens, there is no room for individual thought and it is pressed into the viewer\u2019s brain that there is only one way to think and that is with the protagonist. According to Vox, It\u2019s a beautifully shot movie with a story that follows the traditional arcs of a fairy tale romance. I believe that it is exactly why it should not have won, it has been done before. Compared to other past winners, such as Moonlight, which was original and intriguing. There is no relevance to the Shape of Water, no bigger picture. A mute woman falls in love with a sea creature who likes eggs. If that\u2019s the precedent for winning an Oscar, then The Leprechaun would have been a phenomenal candidate. The movie is visually outstanding, but so is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and it is an incredibly lifeless movie starring Brad Pitt Without the visuals the movie would merely be a pathetic case for an \u201coriginal\u201d plot. Quite honestly, coming from Guillermo del Toro I would not expect much, all of his movies rely on visuals such as Crimson Peak or The Hobbit. These movies appeal to the eye and the only Oscar that this movie truly deserved was Best Visuals. Overall, the movie is basic with jaw dropping visuals.

I would like to claim that if A fetus is a person with full rights, and A parent has an obligation to care for their offspring earlier than the age of 18, then bodily autonomy is irrelevant to the discussion . Note I personally do not oppose abortion I disagree with premise \\ 1. Here's the Violinist Thought Experiment, which is a thorough introduction to the topic of bodily auonomy The basic claim behind the bodily autonomy argument is that even if a fetus were considered a full person with rights, it would still be ethical to abort him, just like it's ethical to disconnect a famous violinist from your kidneys if you don't want your body being used for his life support. First criticism Suppose you're holding a knife at an adult's chest. Would it be ethical to make your brain send a signal to your arms, telling them to expand and push the knife through the person's chest? If not, then there is no inherent right to bodily autonomy if exercising it would violate other people's rights. Second criticism Do people have the right to not support their family, and not ensure that their children are fed? Can someone claim bodily autonomy as a defense if their own offspring starve to death from neglect? To wrap this all up under the abortion discussion, I'm essentially claiming that even if we grant people the right to bodily autonomy, then we still have to make people suffer the consequences of exercising their bodily autonomy . What this means is that a woman is not responsible for getting a famous violinist sick, so she is not primarily responsible for killing him if she disconnects herself from his life support. However, if she made the violinist sick by having sex, then she is ultimately responsible for the violinists' death, regardless of the presence or absence of parasitic life support. Essentially, saying that I have a right to bodily autonomy, and hence abortion is akin to saying I don't care for the consequences of my actions . A more persuasive argument for abortion would be Jeremy Singer's utilitarian argument A fetus has far less consciousness than a living mother, so the lifelong convenience of the mother matters far more than the life of the fetus. Steven Levitt's Freakonomics argument Abortion reduces crime and improves society. The economic argument Real wages in the U.S. have been falling for decades in this country. A child cannot be raised in an environment where the parents haven't been working for at least 5 years with good careers.

Let's take as an example of just 10 minutes sorting out a postal vote, filling it in, and sending it off. Many people value their time let's take a figure of \u00a310 hour I'd be willing to spend \u00a310 to have an hours free time, or you'd need to pay me \u00a310 to do something for an hour. Ten minutes would then be worth a bit more than a pound. Now consider what I gain from voting the possibility of changing the government. But what is the probability? There are 650 constituencies in the UK, and they're voted on every 5 years. In the last hundred years, that adds up to roughly 13000. According to wikipedia, not a single election in the last hundred years has been decided by one vote However, there was one a little more than a hundred years ago so let's take a rough probability of 1 in 13000 chance of changing a constituency seat. I imagine the probability is significantly lower in reality However, for many people the reason to vote is not intrinsically for an MP, but for a national party. So we also need to consider the possibility that my MP will be the one that decides the government. As far as I can tell, the government hasn't been decided by one MP for at least a hundred years let's take an absurdly high probability of 1 20 of the government being decided by 1 MP, and 1 650 chance of it being my MP. Now when I vote the probability that I decide the government is 1 20 1 650 1 13000 1 169,000,000. But what is the value to me of which government is in power? We can consider the value to me personally how much I gain in benefits, or lose in taxes or how much I care about other people. In effect, the question is what I would pay to change which party is in power. For it to be worth me voting, the question of which government is in power would need to be worth a somewhat staggering \u00a3200 million. I certainly do not care that much. I recognise that the figures I have used are wild estimations. However, they would need to be wrong by a huge factor for it to be worth voting. In this way voting seems to be like buying a lottery ticket but with a lower probability of winning and a lower reward There are times when your vote can matter more. If you're working with a small party, then your vote makes up a more significant part of the total and helps that party get their voice heard. Or if there is a larger benefit to having your particular MP for example, people voting Caroline Lucas wanting to have at least one Green MP, or an MP fighting particularly hard for local issues . However I would then argue that since in general it isn't worth it for me to vote, the burden of proof or at least evidence would be on those saying I should. I am not particularly induced to voting by being called an idiot, which seems to be how a significant number of people refer to nonvoters. Some arguments I've heard go along the lines of 'If everyone thought that way, no one would vote ' True. However, as the number of people voting go down the probability of my vote mattering goes up. At some point, it will pass the sweet spot that makes it worth it to vote. I would, for reasons along these lines, support a mandatory voting system with the option for 'none of the above' . This would mean that instead of voting having a cost of \u00a31 as above, it has a gain not being fined . TLDR Like the lottery, voting has a cost. Like the lottery, voting gives you a small probability of winning. However, the cost to voting is higher, the probability of winning is lower, and the payoff is lower.\n", "reference": "Voting is worse than playing the lottery (primarily UK)\n", "hypothesis": "There are 650 constituencies in the UK, and they're voted on every 5 years.

A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. If he is unplugged from you now, he will die but in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you. Given this argument, I'd agree to terminating the famous violinists life. However, it seems to me to be an invalid argument for abortion. I take issue with the premise that you had no choice in being attached to this violinist. As the analogy is being drawn to pregnancy, unlike in this thought experiment you still are making a choice when engaging in the act of procreation. Granted, you may be using contraception with the intent of not having a baby when you get it on, but intent is much different than choice. It seems to me that the more accurate though experiment one could run would be as follows as to whether abortion should be allowed You are placed in a room with a button. You are told that every time you press the button, you get 100. However, every time you press the button, you have a 1 100 chance of bring kidnapped and plugged into the circulatory system of a world famous violinist. You press the button, and oh poor unlucky sap you this happens to be your unlucky day You get 100 but you are kidnapped. Is it morally permissible for you to disconnnect from the violinist? To me, it seems the answer would be no, since you consciously made the choice to press the button for the reward, a choice that incurred the risk of getting kidnapped to save the life of a certain violinist.

The video talked mostly about allowing citizens to purchase machine guns fully automatic, as in one trigger hold would allow for the firearm to dispense all the ammunition in its magazine just like purchasing any other firearm. I wrote a comment on the Youtube video, which I copied here gt The problem is not that law abiding citizens will commit crimes with these firearms. Unfortunately, society dictates that laws must be passed in accordance with the weakest link worst case scenario in mind. I do support the right for a righteous person to own a gun, but the fact of the matter is that, even now, a lot of new gun owners have no clue what they are doing when they buy a gun, much less so a machine gun. gt If anything, there should be a requirement to know how to handle a gun before being able to purchase one, just like there is a requirement for buying a car knowing how to drive, earning a license by taking a written field test, etc. . Even with cars, people take driver's ed and still end up in crashes, so there is the chance that accidents will happen with licensed firearm users. In general, I believe that people should be given a government subsidized licensing program to be able to own purchase firearms, just as they do for cars. gt How this relates to machine guns is that machine guns are even more unruly and harder to grasp due to media suppression. I would suppose that it would be best to have machine guns as another level of licensing, just like how you can't drive a trailer truck without the proper driver's license class. gt I think that this is the best compromise for everybody gun control advocates win because us gun owners are now held to a higher standard of education and responsibility, and gun owners win because we are allowed additional provisions silencers, machine guns, etc. if we choose to study, and test for them.

For context TERF refers to a 'Trans gender Exclusionary Radical Feminist', someone who usually female identifies with radical feminist rhetoric but holds a negative exclusionary stance towards trans people and rejects modern scientific consensus on gender. The term TERF was coined roughly 10 years ago within a pro trans blog post, being used to refer to the stance in a neutral and academic manner. Since then, it's gradually gained prominence within LGBT circles as a term to refer to radfems who exclude trans people. I'd first argue TERF isn't a slur, since it has a specific, objective meaning, and is not derogatory in definition or in most of its usage. Comparable terms which are commonly used to refer to unpopular ideologies, generally in a derogatory context, are not considered slurs i.e. 'Communist', 'Racist', 'Nazi' . I am also unaware of an alternative term to TERF which is not either excessively long winded and or loaded. Secondly, if I were to agree TERF is a slur by definition, I don't believe it's problematic. Subscribing to an ideology is voluntary, and in my opinion an ideology should not recieve the same protections as a factor beyond a person's control. Using the term 'slur' seeks to draw a parallel to things such as racial slurs in a bad faith attempt at appearing the victim. CMV. What WON'T change my view Discussion of gender science, legitimacy illegitimacy of TERF viewpoints, anything peripheral to the discussion of the word.

I despise his rhetoric, his anti intellectualism, and I believe he will reverse many of the strides Obama made toward making America a more respectable and responsible global power. That being said, recently John Oliver of whom I'm a big fan , called Trump's questioning Mexican American Judge Curiel's impariality the dictionary definition of racism Paul Ryan said almost exactly the same thing around the time of Trump's comments, but replaced dictionary with textbook A cursory Google search reveals a plethora of assenting opinions, here's one from the New Yorker This argument is as specious as it is ubiquitous. For starters, the way Ryan and Oliver frame the issue is disingenuous saying someone is unfit to do their job because of their race is the definition of racism. This is misleading Trump was not saying Curiel was unfit as a judge because of his Mexican heritage, but that he couldn't be impartial in this case because of his Mexican heritage. Trump made it clear that this was not because of any deficit of Mexicans or even Curiel in particular, but because of his anti Mexico stance and rhetoric. These are completely different things. If Trump was campaigning on blockading Britain and deporting thousands of British people, I would also think it a conflict of interest if one of the Judge's parents was British. I do not think, in any case, that potential conflicts of interest should automatically disqualify anyone for anything. However, decades of psychological research has shown that bias is ingrained into the human condition. Therefore, we should give no special exemption to race in scrutinizing every possible avenue of bias in our judges.

For example Let's say a small agrarian town is located near the ocean. Currently, the property tax for the area is based upon the value of the farmland, which is pretty cheap. Later, some developers see the beauty of the area and begin building designer homes near the beachfront. The town quickly explodes with population as people want to live in this coastal paradise. Some farmers are not happy with the change in their town and refuse to sell their beachfront farms to developers. The problem for the farmer, however, is that Uncle Sam has increased his property tax. The government now appraises his land at a much higher value than what his farmland used to appraised at. So instead of paying property tax on a 50,000 lot, he is now paying property tax on a 500,000 lot. The government has determined the most efficient use for the lot is high income residential zoning. While the government will not force the farmer off of his lot, Uncle Sam incentives the farmer to sell to developers by making the property tax too burdensome for his current use of the land. While this sounds insensitive, it is what guarantees cities aren't choked by holdout landowners that do not want to develop their property. Imagine if lower Manhattan still had a couple single residential houses in the midst of commercial skyscrapers Prop 13 Prop 13 amended the California Constitution to limit property tax to 1 of the property when sold or newly constructed upon. Tax inflation can only increase by a factor of 2 . Going back to our example The farmer is upset about all of these newcomers and does not sell his land. Californian government cannot give him incentive to sell his land by raising property tax. Instead, his property tax will remain at 1 w 2 capped inflation of whatever he bought it at, which probably was dirt cheap. The coastal town's downtown region is choked out by scattered farms, and the land that was sold and developed skyrockets in price. With a lack of land to develop, housing prices increase and the town enters a housing crisis. This phenomena is happening in Los Angeles. The government is powerless to tax the land at what it could appraise for. This also makes it difficult for the government to alleviate housing shortages by appraising single residential zoned areas as medium or dense residential zones.

So lets look at why. Lets start with polling data According to Five Thirty Eight Cruz has a 52 chance of winning Iowa with Trump behind at 31 . However, if you take a look at the most recent polls added to their list, ones from Jan 13 19 you Trump is polling either ahead by 1 or behind by 2 . These polls were conducted either before or during the recent announcements by Sarah Palin and Terry Branstad coming out in support of Trump or against Ted Cruz in Terry's case anyone but Cruz . This will likely cause a drop in Cruz's support in the next few days leading up to the Iowa caucus and with Trump polling ahead of Rubio the most common third place finisher he stands to gain the most. Demographics of Iowa In 2012 the demographics of voters in Iowa were as follows Trump's and Cruz's numbers are in brackets afterwards . 57 male T 47 male, C 22 Female 58 45 years old C 18 50 52 college Degree T 32 without college degree 57 Evangelical T 44 non evangelical, C 20 Evangelical 99 White These numbers show that Cruz, who overlaps well with the evangelical vote as compared to Trump, should have a strong lead over Trump. However, the close polling seems to indicate that Trump is making up ground elsewhere with voters. Determining where he is making up the ground is hard, as the two Five Thirty Eight polls listed above polled Likely Voters LV which usually do not count voters who have not voted in the past. Similar to Sanders' Trump will likely rally the voters without a college degree in Iowa, who are under represented in polls, and win the state. Iowa's effect on NH, and current polling in NH According the Five Thirty Eight Trump is the predicted winner with a 46 chance as opposed to Cruz who has jumped from third to second with a 15 chance. Recent polling Jan 15 18 puts Trump up by between 7 and 20 . NH demographics, which I wont list out here but have, in the 2008 Republican primary fit better with Trumps voting block then they do with Cruz's. Iowa may have an effect on NH. According the exit polls from the 2008 primary 50 of voters decided in the last week on who to support and 22 in the last month. A win for Trump in Iowa will show that he has the support of the more conservative base while also rallying the independent vote in NH. From there winning the nomination is almost guaranteed as no candidate other then Bill Clinton has won a nomination without winning either Iowa or NH and the best establishment candidate is probably Rubio but without the support of either state it will be unlikely that he will win the nominee. So just for the record I put the likely hood of this happening somewhere between 65 75 .

Just by eating anything you\u2019ve contributed to killing something else. I\u2019ve found that we can sort things into three levels. First is just anything that\u2019s alive, aka like the grass, trees and everything else on the list. Things that only reach this level people don\u2019t seem to care for much at all on a individual scale. Like cutting down a tree in your front yard is considered a perfectly moral thing to do. The next level I\u2019m not sure what to call but it involves consciousness. This is the level where the being seemingly making decisions and or capable of feeling pain, like cows or chickens. The next and so far last level is personhood, the one that we are special for, for the most part. Personhood can be defined in different ways, but I\u2019m going to define a person as someone with Intelligence, Self awareness, and Consciousness. The main problem I have with people saying that life begins at conception is that they say that being alive is all that matters but imply only that applies to to humans. And I see no logical reason to consider humans important outside of their personhood. The problem with this is that people have a built in idea that human life is important. It makes sense that we have it, it makes animals in the same species help each other and thus helps prevent extinction. But this is getting in the way of our new ability of being able to think of better more efficient ways of things. So if human life is only considered important because we are biologically inclined to think so, what makes it important at all? What I\u2019ve come to think is that our personhood is what makes us important. That this level is so complex that people separate the idea of the mind from the body because they can\u2019t comprehend that their when compared to any other life advanced idea couldn\u2019t possibly be grounded in a physical realty. To pull my rant back to the original topic the idea that anything that\u2019s alive is too important to end, while would be nice, isn\u2019t possible for our species to survive. Therefore you must be more specific, with giving me a logical reason that humans have more of a reason to exist than other life or do what I did as I couldn\u2019t find a reason for that and raised my standards. You might bring up the idea that preventing personhood is the same thing as ending someone\u2019s life, but I disagree. It only has the same outcome, when ending someone\u2019s life you are taking their life and personhood away from them. While something that is not a person does not have that to be taken away. Your not taking anymore than what you take from the grass when you mow the lawn. So back to the outcomes, with one being going forward with the pregnancy and the other being preventing it at a point before personhood be it after conception or not the outcome is either world personhood population either 0 or 1. Neither one in of itself is a bad thing therefore the decision should be based on the change in quality of live for the current persons, and in my opinion the person most effected are the ones who would be responsible for it.

This argument will especially focus on my case against economic liberalization policies such as privatization, fiscal austerity, deregulation, free trade, and much of any form of reduction in federal spending. Please make certain that your arguments focus on the veracity of whether or not neoliberalism has done more harm than good for mankind. With all of this stated, I shall begin to explain why I hold my views on this matter. First of all in the late 1970's, economic turmoil and stagflation had plagued the Western world and the conventional economic systems of the time seemed incapable of resolving the many economic difficulties that existed at the time. The situation became so horrid in the United States that then President Jimmy Carter deregulated the trucking, banking, and airline industries. Despite this, the economy had not recovered and when Ronald Reagan was elected to the presidency in 1980 he arguably began the total and complete transformation of the United States and subsequently the Western world from a Keynesian economic system into a neoliberal economic system. Reagan began to give tax breaks for the wealthy, expanded the trade deficit, increased defense spending, and further deregulated the financial system. This economic liberalization continued throughout the early 1980's \u2013 mid 2010's as succeeding administrations continued to either advance or keep the neoliberal policies in place. President Bill Clinton in particular advanced neoliberalism with the passing of NAFTA, the repealing of the Glass Steagall Act, the reduction of the social safety net, the attempted privatization of Social Security, and contributing to the stagnation of wages in the United States. All of these economic policies in my judgment seem to have led to the many crises the United States is in now such as the dismantling of its industrial infrastructure, the lack of manufacturing jobs, the severe gap between the wealthy and the impoverished, the highest amount of childhood poverty than any other developed nation on Earth, the destruction of the labor unions, the 2008 financial crisis, and perhaps the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. With the passing of NAFTA and the decline of manufacturing jobs in the United States is there an argument to be made in favor of free trade? Do there exist any examples in which free trade was genuinely beneficial and actually contributed to the prosperity of any nation? Secondly as all of this was occurring in the United States, the citizens of the United Kingdom responded to the economic crisis with the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979. Despite this sense of renewed hope among the Brits that they would once again be able to enjoy prosperity and a high standard of living that did not transpire. By the end of 1980 unemployment nearly doubled, manufacturing output had fallen by 1 6 of what it was previously, and the United Kingdom had declined faster at that point in time than at any point in the Great Depression. Despite all of this, Thatcher continued with her neoliberal policies of privatization, deregulation of industry, the reformation of exchange rates, and the reduction of taxes onto the wealthiest Brits. She continued to abolish social programs and destroyed the trade unions which eliminated the working class' ability to bargain for a fair wage. As the gap between the wealthy and the impoverished continued to widen, Thatcher passed the Poll Tax which taxed each home on the basis of the number of adults residing in them. Given that the poor usually had significantly more people per household with a taxable income a conflict inevitably emerged. Not surprisingly, this resulted in mass demonstrations throughout the United Kingdom which resulted in Thatcher's resignation. Despite this, her successor, John Major, left these policies unaltered and by the time the Labour party came into power under Tony Blair they had begun the completion of many of the uncompleted deregulation and privatization measures. All of this in my judgment laid the groundwork for the United Kingdom's own financial crisis, the United Kingdom\u2019s high income inequality in comparison to other developed countries, and arguably the recent referendum for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union. Given the results of privatization in the United Kingdom is there any case to be made that privatization can work and that it can produce economic prosperity? If so, please cite specific examples. Lastly as the IMF and World Bank began to embrace neoliberalism as their economic worldview, they began to instill their neoliberal economic worldview onto the Middle East and Latin America. Despite the fact that the vast majority of the Middle East at this time consisted of socialist economies with strong regulations, a strong social safety net, and a prosperous economic system, they embraced neoliberalism. Today the Middle East has suffered under severe social inequality and high unemployment which has been used as a recruitment tool for ISIS, Al Nusra, and various other terrorist organizations. This has ultimately fueled terrorism throughout the region and to my knowledge has destroyed what little stability the fragile region once possessed. Neoliberalism was also imposed on Latin America by the IMF and the World Bank but it was primarily as a result of a series of subsequent military dictatorships and the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's. This resulted in the attempted privatization of the water supply of Bolivia which resulted in Bolivians being unable to afford their water bills, Augusto Pinochet of Chile leaving office in 1990 with a 45 poverty rate, 2 5 of an increase in manufacturing unemployment in Brazil between 1990 1997 despite an annual increase in productivity over the same period by 7.6 percent, soaring wealth inequality throughout the region, and further misery and suffering throughout Latin America that ironically resulted in the leftist socialist Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela which would then spread across the continent as Latin America would eventually stray away from neoliberalism and become significantly more socialist. With what is to my knowledge a history of economic failure, do there exist any examples that can be cited to demonstrate that neoliberalism has ever worked in any nation? To summarize, neoliberalism has left the equivalent of a scar on the human race. It has led to economic inequality, high unemployment, the reduction or outright obliteration of social programs that the poor and middle class rely on to survive, several financial crises, an unfair distribution of taxation, and the fueling of terrorism in the Middle East. These are the reasons why I've come to the conclusion that neoliberalism has done more harm than good. Despite all of this, I recognize that I may very well be wrong about all of this and that neoliberalism perhaps has done more good than harm for humanity. That is why I am asking to have my view on this matter challenged. Edit I am overwhelmed by the response I've received from this post and I would like to thank everyone here for contributing to this discussion. I know that I haven't responded to all of your comments and I would like to apologize partly because I didn't expect to see such a large amount of people making their case for neoliberalism at such a swift rate. While I cannot guarantee that I will be able to answer every single one of your comments I will genuinely do my best to do that. So far I haven't been swayed very effectively at least from the arguments I've read so far. I suggest that you consider looking at my examples of where neoliberalism failed and perhaps consider how I may be observing this matter from too much of a far left perspective. I also suggest that you do your best to not revert to any form of logical fallacies in your writing or else it's unlikely I would take your argument seriously. These are merely suggestions and not requirements so only bring up such a form of argumentation if you think you possess a strong, substantive argument that could sway me. Thank you again. Second Edit I would like to apologize for my abrupt absence. I had to prepare and undergo a surgery so needless to say I was preoccupied with extraordinarily important affairs that prolonged my time to respond to all of you within a reasonable time frame. It also didn't help that I needed time to recover from my surgery and I didn't think it would be wise for me to spend my time writing responses over this discussion of a very complex and rigorous issue. I made sure that I recovered before I would continue with this discussion so I would like to thank you all for your patience. As I stated before, I cannot guarantee that I will respond to all of your comments but I will do my best to accomplish that task. Now that I possess an ample amount of time to respond to your comments I'm pleased to acknowledge that all of you here seem to have genuinely attempted to apply the best reasoning you possess to make your case that neoliberalism has done more good than harm for the world. I consider this to be a positive aspect of this discussion because I am receiving insight and wisdom from a very different worldview that I think I have neglected to listen to. From what I've read of your comments so far some of you have really tested my beliefs and have provided a very strong challenge to my comfort zone of the far left view of the world and I welcome this challenge. The main reason why I even wrote this post was because I had recently joined reddit and I had no intention of posting anything on this website if I didn't have anything meaningful to write about. I took notice of this subreddit and realized that I could contribute to an intellectual discussion in which views and ideas are subject to being challenged as opposed to merely being enforced onto others for the sake of one's self image. This intrigued me and I realized then that because of my far left political views that I possessed my own bias against the economic system known as neoliberalism. Everything that I wrote in my original essay was knowingly based on my own far left bias even though it is based on facts and possesses a legitimate form of structure of argumentation. Despite this, it dawned on me that it was unfair of me to have dismissed neoliberalism for the vast majority of my life without hearing the other side's case for it. That is ultimately why I wrote this essay and why I came here to have my view challenged. I realized that I may have been wrong and because I care about the truth I sought to hear the other side. Even if my view isn't changed at end of all of this I can state that at the very least I will have learned significantly more about what neoliberalism truly is than I perhaps have in my entire life and will possess the insight to arrive at a sound judgement on my view of this matter. I did make the mistake of not citing my sources because I was attempting to follow the rules and I wanted to play it safe. However, due to what is in my judgement reasonable and popular demand I shall cite all of my sources of all of my claims in the original essay. When I wrote the essay I looked into various sources and did as much fact checking and I could at the time. Because my essay was rather long in length and reverted to various claims and conclusions in my supporting paragraphs for my thesis, virtually all of the sources have been organized in chronological order and can be quite long. I cannot reasonably expect any of you to read in detail every single one of my sources although I encourage to try if you genuinely want to . I should also note that some of my sources are from academic journals and books some of which aren't easily accessible unless if you possess an account for the website which the source is documented in for you to access it. Rest assured, my claims for those sources are directly cited from them so if you want to see every single detail you must acknowledge that it will be quite a tremendous task if you want to see the total veracity of all of my claims. Otherwise, be prepared for an excessive amount of sources. Sources Jimmy Carter's deregulation of the trucking, banking, and airline industries Ronald Reagan's tax reduction, expanded trade deficit, increase in defense spending, and further deregulation of the financial system The passing of NAFTA and its negative economic impact on American manufacturing and domestic job creation The repeal of the Glass Steagall Act and its direct connection to what enabled the financial conditions that lead to the 2008 financial crisis The reduction of the social safety net in form of The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 and its direct contribution to the United States now leading the developed world in childhood poverty as well as extreme poverty as a whole Bill Clinton and then Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich's attempted privatization of Social Security Wage stagnation in the United States with the advent of neoliberalism How neoliberalism caused the destruction of the labor unions in the United States Note This article covers the entire general history of labor unions in the United States. It doesn't cover into how neoliberalism destroyed the labor unions and show the mathematics of the subsequent decline of labor unions in the years of dominant neoliberalism in the United States until you begin to read the section on the Carter Administration up until the end of the article. If you want to know what I'm specifically citing, just skip to the the Carter Administration and read it until the end. General explanation of my conclusion of how neoliberalism caused the dismantling of the United State's industrial infrastructure, the lack of manufacturing jobs, and the general wealth inequality which has been prevalent in the United States ever since the early stages of neoliberalism How neoliberalism led to the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States and the referendum for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union The United Kingdom's economic health by the end of 1980 Margaret Thatcher's economic policies of privatization, deregulation, the reformation of the exchange rate, and the reduction of taxes Privatization in the United Kingdon starting in the beginning of the Thatcher years Further detail on Margaret Thatcher's deregulation policies Margaret Thatcher's targeting of the trade unions Tony Blair's completion of various privatization and deregulation measures Note I didn't go into much detail in my original essay about Britain's own financial deregulation and how that led to its own financial crisis. In 1986, the British government under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher deregulated the United Kingdom's financial markets by abolishing fixed commission charges, transitioning to electronic screen based trading, and having stockjobber and stockbrokers become the same terminology. This financial deregulation was known as the Big Bang and unfortunately history has not been very kind to its effects on Britain's financial system and the health of its economy. Because of the relative ease of market transactions, Britain found itself in an artificial boom that would succumb to the excess of the illegitimate lending scams and put the saving of depositors at a severe financial risk. In fact, Nigel Lawson, who was Thatcher's Chancellor at the time of the passing of the Big Bang, conceded that the financial crisis was the unintended direct result of the Big Bang's financial deregulation. This is why I came to the conclusion that the neoliberal policies Britain implemented such as deregulation caused their financial crisis. How the Big Bang caused Britain's financial crisis and a financial description of what the Big Bang was as a whole How trade liberalization and government tax and welfare reductions likely led to the United Kingdom's current high income inequality among developed nations The Middle East's transition from socialism to neoliberalism The neoliberal origins of Middle Eastern radicalization The Middle East's unemployment crisis in the aftermath of the implementation of neoliberalism which has subsequently left a lack of jobs for the youth Note I didn't go into detail about this in my original essay but it's important to note that that in the Middle East and North Africa its youth make up more than 40 or 2 5 of its adult population. This describes the scale in which the economic inequality has negatviely impacted the Middle East and North Africa as the youth unemployment there happens to be the highest in the world. Demographics in the Middle East and its relevance to the current youth unemployment and soaring economic inequality in the region The attempted privatization of Bolivia's water supply and the subsequent inability of Bolivians to be able to afford their water bills which resulted in mass protests throughout Bolivia Augusto Pinochet of Chile departure from office in 1990 with a 45 poverty rate Between 1990 1997, Brazil suffered a 40 increase in manufacturing unemployment sector despite the fact that over the same period productivity increased annual at a rate of 7.6 The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela under Hugo Chavez and the subsequent spreading of socialism throughout Latin America Marxism and the Transition to Socialism in Latin America Those are all of the sources I have cited for all of my claims in the original essay. I want to once again thank everyone here for contributing to this discussion and providing their case for neoliberalism. Although this isn't a simple task, I'm quite optimistic at this point that I will be able to respond to all of your comments. It is important to note however that depending on the complexity of the discussion I may write very long responses so that may prolong my response time for each comment I respond to. Nonetheless, thank you again and I'm pleased to have been given the privilege to discuss this very serious topic on this subreddit. Final Edit I now declare that this discussion is over and that my view has changed. I have now concluded that although I still hold the view the neoliberalism has done more harm than good it is something that has done some good in the world in certain nations and that it is capable of doing good for humanity. I used to think that neoliberalism could never work but now I am convinced that it can and that it is usually poorly executed. However, among the cases were it does work it merely works adequately. I want to thank all of you for contributing to this discussion and I wish you all well on this subreddit. Farewell.

I acknowledge positive things that nationalism has done, e.g. in uniting larger groups of people, but I deny that that's because of some intrinsic good in nationalism, rather than the initially false belief that such a good exists. There is nothing meaningful that a rational being could draw from nationalism for themselves, because it is utterly arbitrary Nations' borders are arbitrary For some border it is more likely that the difference that exists between one side of it and the other is the result of the border rather than its cause. Nations' borders have changed drastically and frequently for as long as nation states have existed take for example this time lapse of the past 1000 years there seem to be some inaccuracies, but I think it brings across my point , due to the arbitrary consequences of wars, politics, diplomacy, etc. The cultural and economic differences between people in a single nation state are vastly greater than the average difference between two nations. I would claim this to be true even between First World and Third World countries, although this can be disputed. It is definitely true between countries of the First World only Compare the difference between the average New Yorker and the average Texan, with the difference between the average US citizen and the average Canadian. Compare the similarity between liberals in the US and the EU, with the difference between liberals and conservatives in the US. It is completely arbitrary to share a sense of common identity with almost every person in your nation even though they differ greatly in everything but passport and possibly birthplace, but refuse to share a similar identity with people that live across a border, yet share your interests, ideals, hopes, fears, culture, etc. Membership of a nation's in group is determined by mere chance. You have no control at all over what nation you're born into, and the possibility of changing your nationality through moving to another country and or cultural assimilation in many cases are not very great in particular because almost all nationalists pursue policies that reduce that possibility . The EU is an exception to this, specifically because it is an anti nationalist project. Nationalism out of economic or other self interest of the entire in group i.e. the nation acting in self interest is arbitrary, because it requires you as an individual to potentially work for and sacrifice yourself for another member of that group i.e. against your individual self interest while not requiring you to and possibly preventing you from doing the same for people of other nationalities. There is no such thing as a group's self interest that is not solely based on individual's self interest. Nationalism out of individual self interest is not nationalism, since it is not based on some perceived notion of shared identity with other members of the nation. A self interested person voting for a nationalist party or politician merely because they would profit from particular nationalist policies for example a low wage manufacturing worker in a first world country profiting from protectionism is not a nationalist, as long as self interest is the major motivating factor. Political structures that form a nation's governing body, including the executive, legislative and judicial branches and the documents that define their functioning, can be interpreted to have some kind of value because of how successful they were in working for you, the members of the nation or humankind overall. Nevertheless, most first world democracies are so incredibly similar in their success, compared to the amount of other forms of government that exist right now, that have existed in the past, or that could in theory exist, that there should be an equal or very similar enthusiasm towards all of them, as opposed to merely the particular one that one turns out to be a member of. This argument is not valid for dictatorships which claim to derive their success from the particular dictator yet dictatorships never work in the interest of the nation's people My point is that the people of a nation have to have the arbitrary, and therefore irrational belief that there is something good about nationalism, so that something good can arise from it at all Namely, the inspiration that the people draw from that belief. Still, the belief from a subjective standpoint remains irrational, since any rational person upon finding out that they never had a rational reason to start believing in nationalism would stop believing in it, partly because they wouldn't be able to draw inspiration from something that they know is prima facie irrational. The conclusion can be generalized like this Assume that X is true if and only if P believes in X. Per definition of a rational being Before a rational being takes on a non elementary belief, it needs supporting evidence and rational arguments for that belief. That is, there is an initial point where P doesn't hold the belief that X is true, namely the time where he looks for arguments supporting or opposing X. Given that P is aware of our assumption, P then concludes that X is not true, since at this time he does not believe in it is indifferent towards it. From this time forward P cannot rationally change his belief about X, since that would contradict the assumption. EDIT It's getting pretty late, so I'll respond to the rest of the comments tomorrow.

I didn't know it was an hypothesis, and I didn't have a name for it but I thought that someone probably had thought of it. I just called it the universe being on rails, there was no room for anything else. Forward to my teen years, as I learn more about science, I learned about these problems. I learned that Einstein famously said God doesn't play dice with the universe which was an answer to quantum physics. Now, I didn't understand quantum mechanics, and I still don't, but the nature of it, of being a chance, instead of a mathematical certainty led to a more free interpretation, even leading a lot of mysticism. This led multiple people to exclaim ha ha Got it, there is where free will lies. We're not set in stone. It's the clue we need to conclude we have free will. Well, I'm not convinced. How is the chance of a particle changing state off a probability doesn't make my brain make decision's against the will of nature. If anything, it'd make my brain be chaotic. Our souls aren't controlling what particles do to make us do what we do. That's a huge leap in logic. And plus, the same particles in our brain are the same particles in a rock. Does the rock have exacly the same free will as our brain? I don't see how a statistical chance in an astronomical amount of particles in one's brain makes one's decisions. I've heard plenty of people wax poetical on things like the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics, while completely ignoring the fact that it goes against free will in every way. In multitude of universes where every possibility happens, you have no free will, all the choices are taken, against your will. To aggravate this the more I read biology, psychology, evolutionary psychology etc, the more I convince myself how much our brain is confined to it's biology. The world doesn't like determinists, one often quote mined sentence of Stephen Hawking is gt I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road While completely dismissing what he said next, that it is completely consistent with determinism to do that, as looking before crossing is the cause of the effect not being ran over I've had many people try to convince me we have free will by using emotionally charged arguements such as So, Hitler wasn't wrong because he didn't have any agency . Well, how does that change anything? Does reality change because it doesn't bow to your morals? In the end I don't want to be a determinist. It's not satisfying enough, to know I have no agency, and I'm just living life as a pretend. And I openly admit I live as if the world had free will. I don't live by determinism and I really want to change my view.

First of all, yes, of course it is sexual assault to grab a woman's genitalia without their consent. But it is not sexual assault if it's consensual. And that's what Donald Trump is bragging about in the tape. For reference, here's the transcript of the relevant portion Trump Yeah, that\u2019s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Bush Whatever you want. Trump Grab them by the p . You can do anything. I've bolded the phrase they let you do it because that's a reference to consent, with they referring to the woman on the receiving end of his actions. Trump is not bragging about his wealth and fame allowing him to get away with groping women without their consent, which, again, absolutely would be sexual assault. He is instead bragging that his wealth and his fame make him so sexually attractive to women that they consent to being groped by him. And that's why he and his defenders are so insistent on it being locker room talk. Because while bragging about sexual assault is not normal in locker rooms, outlandish claims about one's sexual attractiveness and prowess absolutely are. And just to be clear, I'm not defending Trump here. I think that Trump did not brag about sexual assault in the tapes, but I'm not saying that if he did what he said he did, those women actually did consent. In fact, given the stories from the women who have come forward so far, I think it's likely that they did not. And I think the takeaway of my view Trump believes he was bragging about consensual sexual activity is that Trump doesn't truly understand what consent is, and that might actually be even worse. But it's worse in a way that underlines just how deeply rooted misogyny is and that can't be dismissed as Trump's a sociopath and an aberration.\n", "reference": "Donald Trump did not brag about getting away with sexual assault in the Access Hollywood tapes.\n", "hypothesis": "Sally Kohn: I don't think Donald Trump was bragging about getting away with sexual assault in the Access Hollywood tapes.

In my opinion this is a terrible idea that is incredibly short sighted. Here is why I think that 1 This won't actually increase the buying power of minimum wage workers. If you, for example, double the minimum wage, the price of everything will double with it. The cost of minimum wage workers will double, the people that made more than minimum wage will want there salary doubled to keep up, all the way up the employees lader. Any company will now have to pay double what they used to to buy from suppliers who now have to pay double for their production and will sell double the price to keep making profit. So everything from food to housing will double in price. Basically, you haven't created any new value but are paying more for the same value. This leads to heavy inflation as the buying power of the dollar decreases. 2 incentive to automate already today, we know the vast majority of low ish end jobs can be done by robots. The only thing keeping it from happening is cost. Right now, designing, programming and manufacturing automatons is too big of an investment. But as minimum wage increases so does the return on investment time diminishes for the upgrade to robots. And so as the minimum wage increases, more and more industries will make the switch, leaving huge parts of the population simply unemployable against there mechanical competition. 3 manufacturing leaving the country this is pretty similar to automation, companies will always go for the most economical options. As long as it is cheaper to produce locally, companies will do so. As soon as it is cheaper to produce in an other country and pay for the transport, companies will go there. This is already the case for many industries like the textile industry, because non perishable products can easily be transported by boats for a relatively low costs. But as the cost difference increases between the two countries, faster means of transport air freight become economically viable, allowing for the export of perishable goods at a lower price than the products locally produced. Which, once again, will lead to vast amounts of jobs no longer available in your country. That's my view and why i hold it\n", "reference": "raising the minimum wage is a terrible idea.\n", "hypothesis": "The cost of minimum wage workers will double, the people that made more than minimum wage will want there salary doubled to keep up, all the way up the employees lader.

My gripe is not completely unsympathetic to them. A hurting farm equals a hurt to the owner, his her family, employees, and the local food crop industry. I get that and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, however it seems that when a farmer is doing it tough there are 60 Minute specials on it, public outcry, sympathy campaigns for government assistance, and viral memes a plenty. A farmer is a business owner, and like all businesses there are great times, shitty times, and times when the worst happens you have to close your doors and cut your losses. A farmer knows all too well that his business relies on things like weather, micro and macro economics, competition, etc. But unlike any other business model, when a farmer starts to go under, he's all over TV complaining about it. No one ever questions why a farm goes under. Maybe it's poor management, maybe it's laziness and stupidity, or maybe the farm shouldn't have aimed to produce water hungry produce right before an El Ni\u00f1o cycle? You hear stories of farmers refusing to leave or sell their land despite a decade of degrading conditions I call this stupid stubbornness. If I owned a business and for whatever reason I started to go broke, then refused to sell or shut down and continued to lose money year after year until I was ready to commit suicide, would I get a shred of sympathy? Or is that just business and do businesses close under these circumstances 1000 times a day everywhere? I know some farmers and when times are good They. Make. A. Fortune. Richest people in the community, by far, and in those times I don't see them giving to the community or donating or sponsoring. No. They relish in their riches with mansions and fast cars and holidays. But when the weather turns and their business starts to suck, it's all, Oh but I'm just a poor old farmer who feeds the nation. Someone bail me out. And finally, I refuse to think of farmers as some kind of super heroes. They make a product for a profit. They don't feed the nation like some kind of generous Messiah. They do it for money. They seem to be put on this pedestal as poor, simple minded folk who grow the corn and feed all the hungry people for free. The reality is that they're highly intelligent, filthy rich in good times and would sell you a cob of corn for 1000 if they could get away with it.\n", "reference": "During tough times, farmers get too much sympathy.\n", "hypothesis": "A hurting farm equals a hurt to the owner, his her family, employees, and the local food crop industry.

A couple of my issues with democracy and yes I know no country is a true democracy, but let's not split hairs 1 Average citizens are ignorant of policy Do we really think that your average citizen knows the ins and out of health care, foreign policy, budget issues, etc etc etc? There plenty evidence to me showing that they don't, and the results of ignorant people being allowed input on important issues is damaging. This is not to mention the tidal waves of disinformation on both sides, making the problem worse. 2 Democracies are short sighted In many cases, governments need to make long term investments for the health of the country and world going forward. Many of these investments won't pay off for decades, and as such don't command the attention of lawmakers more concerned with winning the next election. Education is an example, climate change another, transportation and infrastructure yet another. 3 Democracy encourages pork barrel spending Lawmakers have to bring returns to the citizens in their district and as such many government projects are run inefficiently. Bringing home some military project may be great for the citizens are in a particular district, but it'd likely be more efficient to move our military production to a more centralized location for all sorts of economies of scale. This is but one example. 4 Democracy privileges certain portions of the population over others. We say that democracy gives power to the people, but what of those poor individuals whose right to the franchise is taken or never extended, such as felons, children or immigrants? Moreover, what of those people who can't make it to the polls, or people living in districts where their vote doesn't matter? To head off the well what do you think is better? posts, I'm not truly sure. But I think the idea that democracy by itself is valuable or infallible is a false one, and that we should be investigating new forms of governance to overcome some of these structural dilemmas.
