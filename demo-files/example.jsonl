{"document":"Marseille , France   The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane . Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that   so far no videos were used in the crash investigation .   He added ,   A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators .   Robin 's comments follow claims by two magazines , German daily Bild and French Paris Match , of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps . All 150 on board were killed . Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . The two publications described the supposed video , but did not post it on their websites . The publications said that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation .   One can hear cries of ` My God ' in several languages ,   Paris Match reported .   Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . Towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . Then nothing .     It is a very disturbing scene ,   said Julian Reichelt , editor-in-chief of Bild online . An official with France 's accident investigation agency , the BEA , said the agency is not aware of any such video . Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini , a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site , told CNN that the reports were   completely wrong   and   unwarranted .   Cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they   had n't been exploited yet .   Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois , near Paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , Menichini said . Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , Menichini answered with a categorical   no .   Reichelt told   Erin Burnett : Outfront   that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying Bild and Paris Match are   very confident   that the clip is real . He noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports .   That is something we did not know before . ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning ,   he said . What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot ? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525 , which he 's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps . Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a   previous episode of severe depression ,   the airline said Tuesday . Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation , Lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . The announcement indicates that Lufthansa , the parent company of Germanwings , knew of Lubitz 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . Lufthansa , whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement Tuesday as a   swift and seamless clarification   and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday , where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside . He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes , laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet , closer to the crash site , where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial . Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching . French President Francois Hollande , speaking Tuesday , said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week , sooner than authorities had previously suggested . In the meantime , the recovery of the victims ' personal belongings will start Wednesday , Menichini said . Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board . Check out the latest from our correspondents . The details about Lubitz 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz 's possible motive for downing the jet . A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and   held all the licenses required .   Earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in Dusseldorf , Christoph Kumpa , said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license . Kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday . While flying was   a big part of his life ,   the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . Another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . Lubitz 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the European government official said . But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said Brian Russell , a forensic psychologist .   Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal ,   he said .   But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems .

{"document":"The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories . The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague , in the Netherlands , where the court is based . The Palestinians signed the ICC 's founding Rome Statute in January , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed   in the occupied Palestinian territory , including East Jerusalem , since June 13 , 2014 .   Later that month , the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis . As members of the court , Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well . Israel and the United States , neither of which is an ICC member , opposed the Palestinians ' efforts to join the body . But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki , speaking at Wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice .   As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice ,   he said , according to an ICC news release .   Indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace .   Judge Kuniko Ozaki , a vice president of the ICC , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians .   As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine , Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute . These are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly ,   she said . Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development .   Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership ,   said Balkees Jarrah , international justice counsel for the group .   What 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not Palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members .   In January , when the preliminary ICC examination was opened , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . The United States also said it   strongly   disagreed with the court 's decision .   As we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC ,   the State Department said in a statement . It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations .   We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace ,   it said . But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as   Palestine .   While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would   conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality .   The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June . The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . CNN 's Vasco Cotovio , Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report .","reference":"membership gives the icc jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in palestinian territories since

{"document":"Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions , Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty .   The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year ,   said Salil Shetty , Amnesty 's Secretary General in a release .   It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people 's lives -- putting people to death for ` terrorism ' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence .   The report ,   Death Sentences and Executions 2014 ,   cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December . China is also mentioned , as having used the death penalty as a tool in its   Strike Hard   campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang . The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe , and this year 's edition contains some mixed findings . On one hand , the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22 % on the previous year . At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014 , compared to 778 in 2013 . Amnesty 's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China , where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret . Belarus and Vietnam , too , do not release data on death penalty cases .   The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions ( worldwide ) ,   Audrey Gaughran , Amnesty 's Director of Global Issues , told CNN .   A number of countries are closer to abolition , and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015 . ( There are ) signals of a world that is nearing abolition .   While the report notes some encouraging signs , it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014 . At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year , an increase of 28 % compared with 2013 . The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria ,   against scores of people in some cases .   The organization found   positive developments   worldwide , with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions . Opinion : Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , saw a 28 % fall in reported cases , and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23 % compared to 2013 .   Even though we 've highlighted some of the negative developments ... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments ,   Gaughran said .   Across the board , with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region .   The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions , but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly , from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014 . The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year . The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment , with only Iran ( 289 + ) , Iraq ( 61 + ) , and Saudi Arabia ( 90 + ) executing more people in 2014 . While figures are not available , Amnesty estimates that China also executes   thousands   of prisoners each year ,   more than the rest of the world put together .   The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death .   In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards ,   the report stated .   In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan , Bangladesh , China , Egypt , Iran , Iraq , North Korea , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka .   The United Nations Secretary-General , Ban Ki-moon , last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment .   The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another ,   he said , in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October .   We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights .   Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014 .","reference":"amnesty 's annual death penalty report catalogs encouraging signs , but setbacks in

{"document":"On May 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China 's northwestern Xinjiang region . But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . Instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . Armed soldiers guarded the exits . In the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . Three were sentenced to death . The public mass sentencing was part a China 's   Strike Hard   campaign against unrest in Xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat   terrorism   and   separatism .   But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . Today , Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . Much of it makes for grim reading . In Pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December . More than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . Iran and Iraq executed people for   terrorism ,   and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . In Indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety   national emergency .   Six people have already been executed this year . A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . At Amnesty International , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . Thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . The numbers speak for themselves . In 1945 when the United Nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . Today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice . Last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607 . This number does not include China , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea , Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . The Americas continued to be execution-free , apart from the United States . Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . With determination , I know that we can achieve this goal .","reference":"amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide ; much of it makes for grim reading .salil

{"document":"Seventy years ago , Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15 . Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31 , 1945 , the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust . But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister , Margot Frank , died at least a month earlier than previously thought . Researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross , the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial , along with testimonies of survivors . They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities . In 1944 , Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp . Anne Frank 's final entry . That same year , Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany . Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread , witnesses said . The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting , little water and no latrine . They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents , according to the researchers . Like the other prisoners , the sisters endured long hours at roll call . Her classmate , Nannette Blitz , recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944 :   She was no more than a skeleton by then . She was wrapped in a blanket ; she could n't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice .   Listen to Anne Frank 's friends describe her concentration camp experience . As the Russians advanced further , the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became even more crowded , bringing more disease . A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day . Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene . The disease causes high fever , chills and skin eruptions .   Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes , Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period ,   museum researchers wrote . They concluded that it 's unlikely the sisters survived until March , because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7 .   Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear ,   wrote authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek . The exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear . Margot died before Anne .   Anne never gave up hope ,   said Blitz , her friend .   She was absolutely convinced she would survive .   Her diary endures as one of the world 's most popular books .

{"document":"A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union , university officials said Thursday . The prestigious private school did n't identify the student , citing federal privacy laws . In a news release , it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review . The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday , the university said . Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved . Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well . Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting   We are not afraid . We stand together ,   after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media . At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel , close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m. , hundreds of people gathered .   You came here for the reason that you want to say with me , ` This is no Duke we will accept . This is no Duke we want . This is not the Duke we 're here to experience . And this is not the Duke we 're here to create , '   Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd . The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students . Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant . Two students were expelled . In February , a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi . A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus . In the news release , the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a   cowardly act .     To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act , I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear , it will have the opposite effect ,   Larry Moneta said Wednesday .

{"document":"The Rev. Robert H. Schuller , California televangelist and founder of the television ministry   Hour of Power ,   died Thursday , according to his family . He was 88 years old . Schuller , also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch , had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013 , a release from   Hour of Power   said .   My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning . He was a great Dad and a great man of God ,   said Schuller 's daughter-in-law , Donna Schuller , in a Twitter message . Schuller 's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc . He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days . In his autobiography ,   Prayer : My Soul 's Adventure with God ,   he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation . After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan , he met his wife of more than 60 years , Arvella , while preaching at her church ( she was the organist ) . With their young family in tow , the Schullers caravanned west to California , where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar . It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry , some local pastors huffed . The   passion pits   where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel . Schuller was undeterred , and he quickly outgrew the drive-in . He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a   miracle ,   though his many mainstream critics had other names for it . His confident , breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy , by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers . Schuller sold a softer , gentler message , which borrowed heavily , he acknowledged , from the father of the feel-good gospel , Norman Vincent Peale . He preached not to convert or condemn people , but to encourage them , a sentiment he called   possibility thinking .   People loved it .   Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people ,   said Timothy Larsen , a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois .   And Schuller was a master at that .     What he got right is that the gospel is good news ,   Larsen continued .   And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope .   Some of Schuller 's favored phrases , though , struck others as cornpone Christianity .   Turn your hurt into a halo ?   said Randall Balmer , a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College , citing one such phrase .   That 's pretty weak tea .   Still , Balmer gives Schuller some credit .   It may be bad theology , but it 's brilliant marketing .   In 1970 , Schuller began broadcasting   Hour of Power ,   believed to be one of the first , if not the very first , Sunday service to be shown regularly on television . With his genial smile , priestly robes and gray hair , he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed . The show , which ran for decades , reached millions , making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors . Schuller 's crowning achievement , at least architecturally , still stands in Orange County , California , though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church . The Crystal Cathedral , a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels , gave worshipers a look at the clouds that house the heavens , while Schuller preached in the pulpit below . The message was clear to many : The road to the former ran through the latter . During the 1980s and 1990s , Schuller 's star continued to rise , with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns , it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice . As Schuller aged , though , his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of   King Lear .   He tried to install his only son , Bobby Jr. , as pastor of Crystal Cathedral . But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance . Bobby Schuller Jr. left   Hour of Power   and the pulpit at Crystal Cathedral after a short time . As the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances , viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously . Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010 , citing debts of more than $ 43 million , according to The Associated Press . Schuller 's empire , which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral , had fallen to dust . Eventually , Schuller 's grandson , also named Bobby , took over   Hour of Power ,   though at a different church . In a statement on Thursday , the younger Schuller recalled standing atop Crystal Cathedral 's 12-story Tower of Hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape .   You could see the whole world from there ,   he said . People we 've lost in 2015 . CNN 's Stella Chan reported from Los Angeles .","reference":"the rev. robert schuller , 88 , had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 2013 .his tv show ,   hour of power ,   was enormously popular

{"document":"Never mind cats having nine lives . A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car , apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive . That 's according to Washington State University , where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital . Four days after her apparent death , the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm , dirt-covered and emaciated , where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help . She was taken in by Moses Lake , Washington , resident Sara Mellado .   Considering everything that she 's been through , she 's incredibly gentle and loving ,   Mellado said , according to WSU News .   She 's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life .   Theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . She suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . The veterinary hospital 's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . She 's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated . Donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by Theia 's tale of survival against the odds . On the fundraising page , Mellado writes ,   She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home .   She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs , Mellado adds , and wants to   make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again !   Any additional funds raised will be   paid forward   to help other animals . Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks . A cat in Tampa , Florida , found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January , showed up alive in a neighbor 's yard five days after he was buried by his owner . The cat was in bad shape , with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye , but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society .","reference":"theia , a bully breed mix , was apparently hit by a car , whacked with a hammer and buried in a field .  she 's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life ,   says sara mellado , who is looking for a home for theia .","sent-rewriting":"a stray pooch in washington state has used up at least three of her own . four days after her apparent death . dog has been receiving care at the veterinary teaching hospital . mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the dog 's care .","ctrl-dec-copy":"washington state university says the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . she suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity . she 's also created a facebook page to keep supporters updated .","reinforced":"never mind cats having nine lives. a stray pooch in washington state university. has been receiving care at the veterinary teaching hospital. never suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries. the dog. to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered.

{"document":"If you 've been following the news lately , there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif . He is , of course , the Iranian foreign minister . He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . And he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning .   Long live Zarif ,   crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . You may well have read that he is   polished   and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues ,   jovial .   An Internet search for   Mohammad Javad Zarif   and   jovial   yields thousands of results . He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known . Here are six : . In September 2013 , Zarif tweeted   Happy Rosh Hashanah ,   referring to the Jewish New Year . That prompted Christine Pelosi , the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own :   Thanks . The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran 's Holocaust denial , sir .   And , perhaps to her surprise , Pelosi got a response .   Iran never denied it ,   Zarif tweeted back .   The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . Happy New Year .   The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad 's successor , Hassan Rouhami . His foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that   due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the United States .   That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran , which began in 1977 , and during the Iranian Revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . Zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988 . Both of his children were born in the United States . The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry , which Zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . The first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran , says Zarif was   born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959 .   Later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as January 8 , 1960 . And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . Whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , Kerry , who is 71 . The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation , a charitable organization . The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions . But last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government , did not mention Zarif 's name . Early in the Iranian Revolution , Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco . The aim , says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif 's memoirs , titled   Mr. Ambassador   -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic . Later , the website says , Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations . In response , the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job . In fact , he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland .","reference":"mohammad javad zarif has spent more time with john kerry than any other foreign minister .he once participated in a takeover of the iranian

{"document":"For the first time in eight years , a TV legend returned to doing what he does best . Contestants told to   come on down !   on the April 1 edition of   The Price Is Right   encountered not host Drew Carey but another familiar face in charge of the proceedings .

{"document":"He 's a blue chip college basketball recruit . She 's a high school freshman with Down syndrome . At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith could n't be more different . But all that changed Thursday when Trey asked Ellie to be his prom date . Trey -- a star on Eastern High School 's basketball team in Louisville , Kentucky , who 's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern 's prom . So why is he taking Ellie instead ?   She 's great ... she listens and she 's easy to talk to   he said . Trey made the prom-posal ( yes , that 's what they are calling invites to prom these days ) in the gym during Ellie 's P.E. class . Trina Helson , a teacher at Eastern , alerted the school 's newspaper staff to the prom-posal and posted photos of Trey and Ellie on Twitter that have gone viral . She was n't surpristed by Trey 's actions .   That 's the kind of person Trey is ,   she said . To help make sure she said yes , Trey entered the gym armed with flowers and a poster that read   Let 's Party Like it 's 1989 ,   a reference to the latest album by Taylor Swift , Ellie 's favorite singer . Trey also got the OK from Ellie 's parents the night before via text . They were thrilled .   You just feel numb to those moments raising a special needs child ,   said Darla Meredith , Ellie 's mom .   You first feel the need to protect and then to overprotect .   Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school , but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her . She said Best Buddies cultivates friendships between students with and without developmental disabilities and prevents students like Ellie from feeling isolated and left out of social functions .   I guess around middle school is when kids started to care about what others thought ,   she said , but   this school , this year has been a relief .   Trey 's future coach at Ball State , James Whitford , said he felt great about the prom-posal , noting that Trey , whom he 's known for a long time , often works with other kids . Trey 's mother , Shelly Moses , was also proud of her son .   It 's exciting to bring awareness to a good cause ,   she said .   Trey has worked pretty hard , and he 's a good son .   Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do . Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major , in addition to playing basketball in the fall . As for Ellie , she ca n't stop thinking about prom .   Ellie ca n't wait to go dress shopping   her mother said .   Because I 've only told about a million people !   Ellie interjected .","reference":"college-bound basketball star asks girl with down syndrome to high school prom .pictures of the two during the   prom-posal   have gone viral

{"document":"Michele Bachmann is comparing President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight .   With his Iran deal , Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks ,   the Minnesota Republican and former representative wrote in a Facebook comment posted March 31 .   After the fact , among the smoldering remains of American cities , the shocked survivors will ask , why did he do it ?   Andreas Lubitz , the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 , is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps . He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers . The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation , though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license . Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative . Melissa Coca wrote ,   Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable .   Michael J Pristash wrote ,   Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive , not to mention disrespectful on so many levels . Shame on you .   Some also accused her of taking desperate measures to stay in the public eye . Lynda Anderson wrote ,   Posting outrageous things in a pathetic attempt to stay relevant ?   Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran , the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran 's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb . One deadline passed Tuesday , but there is a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal -- with all technical and diplomatic impasses fully worked out . Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President 's dealing with Iran , personally telling him to   bomb Iran   during the 2014 White House Christmas Party .   I turned to the president and I said , something to the effect of , ` Mr. President , you need to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities , because if you do n't , Iran will have a nuclear weapon on your watch and the course of world history will change , '   she told the Washington Free Beacon .

{"document":"Los Angeles   It 's more than just one state 's internal problem . The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union , too . That 's because California is a breadbasket to the nation , growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts . Here 's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state , a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25 % cutback in water consumption in all cities . In 2014 , one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought . He was often right , according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards , agribusiness professor at Arizona State University . Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table : . \u2022 Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $ 3.88 . \u2022 Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $ 1.89 . \u2022 Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $ 3.06 . \u2022 Melons by 24 cents a pound to $ 1.23 . \u2022 Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $ 2.91 . \u2022 Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $ 2.39 . Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February , overall prices are expected to rise this year , because of inflation , U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said . Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5 % and 3.5 % , and vegetables between 2 % and 3 % , close to historical average increases , Kuhns said . Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown , thanks to a strong dollar . The greenback 's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation , Kuhns said . Moreover , the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states , she said . What economists do n't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought . Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices , she said .   The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter ,   Kuhns said .   We are not sure what the exact impact will be .   The reality is there 's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest . While not as bad as California , Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states , the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week . Overall , the Western drought affects more than 52 million people , the monitor says . As a result , consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1 % for beef and veal in 2014 , the USDA reports . Straining under a drought that began in 2012 , ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures , paid more for feed , and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle . So the cattlemen began culling their herds , Kuhns said . This year 's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6 % at most , still higher than the 4.1 % historical average , the feds project . But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought .   There 's other areas being affected ,   Kuhns said . It 's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore , but let 's face it : the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason . Its year-round sunshine . So the next time you take a holiday in California , you 'll find a few changes around here , thanks to the drought . Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant . You wo n't find water waiting for you on the table . Eateries now   can only serve water to customers on request ,   the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations . Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily . These requests are mandatory under the new regulations . And they 'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains . Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared , many ski resorts shut down early this year , including at Lake Tahoe , and some are now building zip lines , mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming , the Sacramento Bee reported .   If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more , the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are ,   State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March . But what about those yummy California wines , you ask ? Guess what . They 're only getting better -- because of the drought . Yes , you read that right . The 2014 wine grape harvest was   third in a string of great vintages this decade ,   the Wine Institute says .   California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage , despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway ,   the institute said in a statement last year .   A mild winter and spring caused early bud break , although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years .   Wine grapes use relatively low water , said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi .   Yes , drought years tend to produce terrific quality ,   she added .   With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , there is a good supply of California wine .   That may be the only thing to toast about this drought .","reference":"americans paid more for some fruits and vegetables last year because of the drought .tourists will now have to ask for a glass of

{"document":"As goes Walmart , so goes the nation ? Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week , warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers . But it was the opposition from Walmart , the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape , that perhaps resonated most deeply , providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland . Walmart 's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage . Taken together , the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals . And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice . Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who famously called on the GOP to   be the party of Sam 's Club , not just the country club ,   told CNN that Walmart 's actions   foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move .     The Republican Party will have to better stand for   ideas on helping the middle class , said Pawlenty , the head of the Financial Services Roundtable , a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry . The party 's leaders must be   willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers , such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage , and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs , housing , public accommodation against gays and lesbians .   Walmart , which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas , emerged victorious on Wednesday . Hours after the company 's CEO , Doug McMillon , called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill , the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed . Walmart 's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party , which the company 's political action committee has tended to support . In 2004 , the Walmart PAC gave around $ 2 million to Republicans versus less than $ 500,000 to Democrats , according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics . That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years . In 2014 , the PAC spent about $ 1.3 million to support Republicans and around $ 970,000 for Democrats . It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart . In 2011 , the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity . Two years later , the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014 . Retail experts say Walmart 's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base , as well as a recognition of the country 's increasingly progressive views of gay equality ( support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59 % , according to a recent Wall Street Journal\/NBC News poll ) .   It 's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position ,   said Dwight Hill , a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle .   But in the world of the largest retailer in the world , that 's very different .   Hill added : Same-sex marriage ,   while divisive , it 's becoming more common place here within the U.S. , and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer .   The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community 's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality . After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , a Republican , signed his state 's religious freedom bill into law , CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state . The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions , including Bill Oesterle , CEO of the business-rating website Angie 's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels . Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state 's passage of the religious freedom act . NASCAR , scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer , also spoke out against the Indiana law .   What we 're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business ,   said Jason Rahlan , spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign . The debate has reached presidential politics . National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination . Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana 's religious freedom law and Pence , but moderated his tone a few days later . The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a   better   and   more consensus-oriented approach .     By the end of the week , Indiana will be in the right place ,   Bush said , a reference to Pence 's promise this week to fix his state 's law in light of the widespread backlash . Others in the GOP field are digging in . Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate , said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law .   I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda ,   Cruz said . Meanwhile , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who previously served on Walmart 's board of directors , called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill , saying it would   permit unfair discrimination   against the LGBT community . Jay Chesshir , CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas , welcomed Hutchinson 's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state 's bill . He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies .   When it comes to culture and quality of life , businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that 's its people ,   Chesshir said .   Therefore , when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things , then the business community will again speak and speak loudly .","reference":"while republican gov. asa hutchinson

{"document":"A year ago Bloomberg published a story with the following headline : Mike Pence , a Koch Favorite , Mulls 2016 Run for President . The story ticked off items on Pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups . Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event ; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers , and supported Gov. Pence 's tax-slashing budget . Now , Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana 's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? Because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence 's way of shoring up his street cred . It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush , Pence 's fellow White House hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law . One lesson here : Just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . Backlash aside , the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him -- and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped . Pence : ` Was I expecting this kind of backlash ? Heavens no . ' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters . I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . Instead it looks like it 's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan 's   cultural war   speech , during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention :   We stand with ( George H.W. Bush ) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women   and later followed with   There is a religious war going on in this country . It is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself . For this war is for the soul of America .   Progressives may enjoy watching Pence 's temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table . And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination , someone has to . In light of that , listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives ' discomfort with same-sex marriage :   It 's like asking someone who 's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli .   Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal :   I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage .   Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions . And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay , so there 's that . Remember : Pence did n't act alone . He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . In fact , according to the American Civil Liberties Union ,   the Indiana RFRA -LSB- Religious Freedom Restoration Act -RSB- is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment .   Who supports , denounces Indiana law ? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . Perhaps we 're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases . Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts , the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary .   We 're winning ,   he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book . I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . That 's assuming you are part of the   we   who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual\/cisgender counterparts . But as the situation in Indiana has shown ,   winning   should not be mistaken for having   won .   For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called   religious freedom   bills snaking through red-state legislatures . Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it 's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate . Pence , and to a lesser extent , Jeb Bush , may be toxic now but America has a short attention span . More importantly , they are not alone . Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . If that holds true in 2016 ,   winning   is going to feel very strange .","reference":"lz : indiana law pushing back lgbt rights , and other states ' anti-lgbt moves , bow to far right wing that gop candidates need for 2016 .cruz , huckabee , jindal , carson , walker are reviving culture wars , he says . equality for lgbt has not yet   won   in america .","sent-rewriting":"mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . the group is backed by the conservative koch brothers . pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law . it is also the reason why republican jeb bush , pence 's fellow white house hopeful .","ctrl-dec-copy":"bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . now , pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law .","reinforced":"pence, a year ago bloomberg published 0000. same-sex marriage is legal. to-to-do list. koch brothers. pence's tax-slashing budget. pence is in dallas for an americans for prosperity event. the indiana governor was in. to. . the. is. to a. . . and. . he says. a bill. . for. . in. .,. . she says. . a. ?. . of. .","lstm-pn-rl":"one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . it is also the reason why republican jeb bush , pence 's fellow white house hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend pence and the law .","jointly-learning":"a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . who supports , denounces indiana law ?","tf-pn":"one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it .","gan":"mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians .","bert-lstm-pn-rl":"a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it .","get-to-point":"bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups .","unified-inc-loss":"bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups . last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event .","bert-tf-pn":"one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it .","transformer-abs":"mike pence 's controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . pence 's fellow white house hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend pence and the law","bertsum-ext-abs":"john avlon : mike pence , a koch favorite , is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law . he says there 's no way a republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights . avlon : pence 's stance on same-sex marriage is enough to drag the entire republican field farther to the right","banditsum":"a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups . last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event ;

{"document":"Norfolk , Virginia   The second mate of the Houston Express probably could n't believe what he was seeing . Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby . At first it looked abandoned . It was in bad shape , listing to one side . The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked . Incredibly , as they got closer , they saw there was a man on it , signaling for help .   He was moving , walking around , waving to us and in surprisingly good condition ,   Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday . That man , Louis Jordan , 37 , had an amazing story . He 'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway , South Carolina , to fish in the ocean . Just a few days into his trip , a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast . One of his shoulders was broken , too , so he could n't fix the boat right away . Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail , but he could make little headway against the currents .   It took so long ,   Jordan said .   It moved so slowly .   The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued , according to Jordan . His father , Frank Jordan , told CNN 's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different .   He looked good . Had n't lost too much weight . He was n't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be ,   he said . Lost at sea for 66 days . After his food and water ran out , it became an issue of survival . Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan . The weather would n't cooperate . Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing . The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions .   I had tried to collect ( rain ) water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat ,   Jordan said .   The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad .   Finally the conditions were right . I filled up my water tank , which is 25 gallons . I filled up a bucket .   Then there was the issue of food . The fish were n't cooperating , but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry , which he would put out to sea for a rinse . The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net , he said . Jordan came ashore Thursday evening . CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk , Virginia , reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan 's incredible story . They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing . Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son 's appearance , saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time . His son spent most of his days in the cabin , out of the sun . Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal .   I know he went through what he went through ,   Frank Jordan said . Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway . He had free rent and free food in the river , he said . But when it became difficult to catch dinner , he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish . Frank Jordan told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son , who is an inexperienced sailor , but he held hope because his son had a good boat . And he had the strength to make it .   He 's got a very strong constitution and ( is strong ) not only physically , but spiritually ,   Frank Jordan said .   And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time , so I believe that sustained him a great deal .   Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land .   You would expect sunburns , severe sunburn , blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him ,   he said .   But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing .   Grenz was also surprised by Jordan 's condition , physically and mentally . The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was , remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days . Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry .   We took him to a rescue boat ,   the container ship captain said .   He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again .   Derriel Morris , a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat , named   Angel .   Morris said :   It was immaculate , it was gorgeous , beautifully painted . I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat .   Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer . But when he returned to the marina , Jordan had slipped away .   There was no shore line , no hose ; it was like he was never there ,   Morris told the station . After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony . The marina 's manager , Jeff Weeks , told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week .

{"document":"Paul Walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production . But Walker 's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the   Fast and Furious   film franchise . The release of   Furious 7   on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood .   He was a person of humility , integrity , and compassion ,   military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN . Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride .   We did n't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him . I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us ,   said Upham . The actor was on break from filming   Furious 7   at the time of the fiery accident , which also claimed the life of the car 's driver , Roger Rodas . Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker 's character , Brian O'Connor , a former cop turned road racer . Instead , the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes , with Walker 's brothers , Cody and Caleb , serving as body doubles . There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending , in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while   retiring   his character . At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood , Walker 's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening , saying   This movie is more than a movie .     You 'll feel it when you see it ,   Diesel said .   There 's something emotional that happens to you , where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you 're gon na see them .   There have been multiple tributes to Walker leading up to the release . Diesel revealed in an interview with the   Today   show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker . Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor . A week after Walker 's death , about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles . Most had never met him . Marcus Coleman told CNN he spent almost $ 1,000 to truck in a banner from Bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial .   It 's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face ,   Coleman said .   Sitting there , bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV , it 's like getting to know somebody . It really , really hurts .   Walker 's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how   Furious 7   would turn out , but he is happy with the film .   It 's bittersweet , but I think Paul would be proud ,   he said . CNN 's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report .","reference":"furious 7   pays tribute to star paul walker , who died during filming .vin diesel :   this movie is more than a movie    furious 7

{"document":"The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne , Switzerland , on Thursday that limits Iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . Expect pushback anyway , if the recent past is any harbinger . Just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress , and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal . The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light . It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions . Let us address some of these : . The most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran . That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress . But that is not and never was the objective . If it had been , there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table . Rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond . The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal . It would reduce Iran 's low-enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime . Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program . Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies , Iran denies having such a program , and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon . Iran 's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about Iran 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal . In fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians . What 's more , the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran ( i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president ) . This of course is not the case . The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council ( United States , United Kingdom , France , China and Russia ) plus Germany , dubbed the P5 +1 . While the United States has played a leading role in the effort , it negotiated the terms alongside its partners . If the agreement reached by the P5 +1 is rejected by Congress , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas . Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases . Again , this is not the case . Some of the restrictions on Iran 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years . But most importantly , the framework agreement includes Iran 's ratification of the Additional Protocol , which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared . This provision will be permanent . It does not sunset . Thus , going forward , if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council . Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to   advise and consent .   But the issue is not suited for a treaty . Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories . For example , the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads . But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced . The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran . The P5 +1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions , which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal . Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs , human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah . As important as these issues are , and they must indeed be addressed , they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal : preventing a nuclear Iran . To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill . This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies , including Israel . Those judgments should be fact-based , not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions .","reference":"richard klass : iran framework agreement on nukes is strong , but opponents will cast

{"document":"Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat : a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning . Here 's how it 's unfolding : . It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time , when the moon began moving into Earth 's shadow . For the next hour and 45 minutes , that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time . The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds , and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century . Watch it live on NASA TV . While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view , at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation . But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast . Parts of South America , India , China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse , but it wo n't be visible in Greenland , Iceland , Europe , Africa or the Middle East . A lunar eclipse happens when the sun , Earth and moon form a straight line in space , with the Earth smack in the middle . The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow . As the moon moves deeper into that shadow , it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color . Why red ? Because Earth 's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light . Some people have nicknamed the effect the   blood moon .   NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year , but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row , known as a   tetrad .   The first was on April 15 , 2014 . The second was in September 2014 , the next is Saturday and there will be one more , on September 28 . If you want to learn more about the eclipse , NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will take questions on Twitter @NASA_Marshall . Did you see the total lunar eclipse ?

{"document":"Standing up for what you believe . What does it cost you ? What do you gain ? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out . The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state 's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they 'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple 's wedding .   If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding , we 'd have to say no ,   Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend . The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics , who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians . They called for boycotts . But supporters also rallied . And by the end of the week , they had donated more than $ 842,000 for the business . Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week . RiskyLiberal tweeted :   Dear #MemoriesPizza . No . My boycotting your business because I do n't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion .     Do n't threaten #MemoriesPizza   tweeted A\u10e6anda .   Just mock them for their ignorance .   Bad reviews flooded the restaurant 's Facebook page , most having little to do with the quality of the food . Many too vulgar to share .   Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens ? BOYCOTT MEMORIES PIZZA !!   said Rob Katz of Indianapolis .   Let 's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business .   Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday .   Who 's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza ?   Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted , according to the Walkerton Police Department . The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted . Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment , intimidation and threats , according to Charles Kulp , assistant police chief . The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of Walkerton . A man stood outside Memories simply holding a sign that reads   bigots .   Jason Narducy bought $ 100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out , WBND reported .   Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza ?   Narducy asked . But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support .   Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill Christians & burn down their businesses ,   said a tweet from Victor Nikki .   What 's happening to #MemoriesPizza is n't the free market , it 's a lynch mob ,   tweeted Savannah .   Cyber bulling is n't the same as taking your business elsewhere .   Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza . By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday , $ 842,387 had been raised . The purpose of the campaign is   to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors ' stand for faith ,   according to Lawrence Billy Jones II , the man who started it . For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream . It was n't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs , they told WBND .   That 's a lifestyle that you choose . I choose to be heterosexual . They choose to be homosexual ,   Kevin O'Connor told the TV station .   You ca n't beat me over the head with something they choose to be .   Faced with threats against business , they 're still weighing the cost .

{"document":"It 's the kind of thing you see in movies , like Robert Redford 's role in   All Is Lost   or Ang Lee 's   Life of Pi .   But , in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days , weeks , if not months and somehow living to talk about it . Miracles do happen , though , and not just in Hollywood . We 're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the U.S. Coast Guard . Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard , if any . In order to survive , they ca n't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city , town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity , resourcefulness and luck . It 's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly , with a sailor dying at sea , except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues . Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says , a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts . Below are a few recent examples : . Louis Jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from South Carolina in late January . He headed into the Gulf Stream looking for a good spot to catch fish . And then everything -- his boat , his life -- turned upside down . Rescued man says he is ` utterly thankful ' Not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke , Jordan said . And so , too , did his shoulder . He bought time by rationing water , then collecting fresh water in a bucket . As to food , Jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish . And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail . But , Jordan said ,   It took so long . It moved so slowly .   His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a German-flagged container ship , the Houston Express , spotted Jordan about 200 miles off the North Carolina coast on Thursday . After their reunion , his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads .   I thought I lost you .   Jose Salvador Alvarenga says his journey began in Paredon Viejo , a port on Mexico 's Pacific coast , in late 2012 . The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December , locals say it was November . But what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared . Until January 2013 . That 's when Alvarenga interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the Marshall Islands . Castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in Pacific . What was supposed to be a one-day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the Pacific Ocean , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive . His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course . Then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems . Four weeks in , Alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old Ezequiel Cordova , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds . The days , weeks and months ran together after that . Alvarenga says he drank rainwater and , when there was n't any available , his own urine . He ate sea turtles . Then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the Ebon Atoll , about a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro . The atoll has one phone line , no Internet service and a few residents , two of whom Alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods . The El Salvador native told CNN that his faith in God helped him survive .   I thought , ' I am going to get out ,   he said .   Get out , get out , get out .   Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement , reining it in a few notches as life slows down . And if you live in Hawaii , there 's even more reason to take it easy . The thing is : Ron Ingraham is n't one of those people . He 's a fisherman . The sea is both his life and livelihood , his son , Zakary , told CNN . And he 's tough , with his son jokingly comparing him to Rambo . Still , even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what Ron Ingraham went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the Hawaiian island of Molokai . Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea . After bad weather hit , Ron Ingraham told CNN affiliate KHNL\/KGMB that his 25-foot sailboat went   backwards all night long .   At one point , a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well . The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in . But his boat could n't be rescued so easily , leaving him at the mercy of the current . A distress call went out , prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles . When a Coast Guard official told him the search was being called off December 1 , Zakary Ingraham responded ,   I do n't feel like he 's dead . I do n't feel it .   He was right . Twelve days after that first distress call , Ron Ingraham was picked up about 64 miles ( 103 kilometers ) south of Honolulu   weak , hungry and dehydrated   and -- most importantly -- alive . The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him . In February 2012 , two friends asked 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition . He said yes , and the three set off from the Panama town of San Carlos on a small boat , Vasquez 's mother , Nilsa de la Cruz , recalled . Things started out well , by all accounts . The three caught plenty of fish . Then , their boat 's engine died without warning . And , with no tools and scant navigational experience , the trio did n't know what to do , according to Vasquez 's mother . Mother calls Panama teen 's return ' a miracle ' Vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat , the Fifty Cents , further and further from the coast and into the Pacific Ocean . Somewhere along the way , his two companions died . It 's not clear exactly how , with Ecuadorian Rear . Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle saying Vasquez threw their bodies into the sea   because they had become badly decomposed .   Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began , fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the Galapagos Islands . The Ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor , who 'd lost 20 pounds and showed   severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition ,   according to Calle . He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him , but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal .   For us , this is an opportunity to get closer as a family ,   his mother said by phone ,   to be more understanding and loving .   Sometimes one does n't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled . Sometimes people do n't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end . For proof , look no further than Hiromitsu Shinkawa . 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers . He was at home on March 11 , 2011 , when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo . A devastating tsunami followed , its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors . By the time it had run the course , nearly 16,000 people were dead . It 's a miracle Shinkawa was n't one of them . Shortly after the quake , he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of Minamisoma . His home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge , powerful tsunami wave .   I was saved by holding onto the roof ,   the 60-year-old said , according to Kyodo News Agency .   But my wife was swept away . ' More than two days later , video showed Shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood , shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles ( 15 kilometers ) out to sea . He was waving a self-made red flag . After being spotted by crew aboard a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat , he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears , Kyodo reported . Shinkawa told his rescuers ,   I thought today was the last day of my life .","reference":"a south carolina man says he spent 66 days alone at sea before being rescued .other sole survivor stories include a japanese man washed away by a tsunami .an el salvador man says he drifted from mexico to marshall islands over a year .","sent-rewriting":"robert redford 's role in   all is lost   or ang lee 's   life of pi   jose salvador alvarenga says his journey began in paredon , a port on mexico 's pacific coast . much rarer are lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water . but in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded . the u.s. coast guard is not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground .","ctrl-dec-copy":"louis jordan says he is ` utterly thankful ' not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke . jordan says he is ` utterly thankful ' not only one else can prove or refute their accounts .","reinforced":"jordan says he set off on his 00-foot sailboat from south carolina in late january. a big qualifier qualifier since. the coast guard. the sailboat would capsize two more times before crew. of a sailor dying at sea. the.

{"document":"Since Iran 's Islamic Revolution in 1979 , women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men . But the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top Iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events . A plan to allow   women and families   to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year , Deputy Sports Minister Abdolhamid Ahmadi said Saturday , according to state-run media . But it is n't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend . According to the state-run Press TV , Ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events . The rules wo n't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and   families are not interested in attending   them , Press TV cited him as saying . Iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men 's sports events after the revolution , deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-Islamic . During the ensuing decades , the crowds at soccer games , Iran 's most popular sport , have been all male . Iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate President Mohammad Khatami , but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard-line Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power . The Iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions . FIFA President Sepp Blatter called on Iran last month to end its   intolerable   ban on women attending soccer matches , saying the situation   can not continue .   Iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer 's Asian Cup , but the tournament was awarded to the United Arab Emirates . The ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to Iran 's chances of securing the event . The ban came under the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year , when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction . During the match against Iraq , activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami , a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match . Iranian officials have denied that Ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game , saying she was taken into custody for   anti-Iran activities .   The news agency Reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the Court of Appeal . CNN 's Annie Ramos contributed to this report .","reference":"iranian sports official : the ban will be lifted for some events in the coming year .but he says   families are not interested in

{"document":"Washington   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran 's nuclear ambitions , saying he sees better options than   this bad deal or war .     I think there 's a third alternative , and that is standing firm , ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal ,   Netanyahu told CNN 's Jim Acosta Sunday on   State of the Union .   His comments come as Democrats and Republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges , limiting its highly enriched uranium , and increasing inspections . President Barack Obama endorsed the deal , saying it was better than the alternatives . But GOP contenders for the party 's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it , saying it gave Iran too much flexibility . On Sunday , the sparring continued . One Senate Democrat said Netanyahu needs to   contain himself .   And a top Republican said almost any of Obama 's successors as president   could do better .   Netanyahu 's most recent argument against the Iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a March trip to Washington , when he addressed a joint session of Congress -- fueling a Republican push to have the deal sent to Congress before it 's implemented .   It does not roll back Iran 's nuclear program . It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place . Not a single centrifuge is destroyed . Not a single nuclear facility is shut down , including the underground facilities that they built illicitly . Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning , enriching uranium ,   Netanyahu said Sunday .   That 's a very bad deal .   Netanyahu said Iran is a country of   congenital cheating   and that it ca n't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal , which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that . He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with Obama .   I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this , because I think Iran has shown to be completely distrustful ,   Netanyahu said . Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , meanwhile , said she wishes Netanyahu   would contain himself .   The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from Iran and the United States , as well as Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany -- are   on the cusp of something that can be workable .     It 's a framework . It has to be wrapped into a final agreement . There still can be some changes ,   Feinstein said .   But I do n't think it 's helpful for Israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill , a downhill dynamic in this part of the world .   Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS '   Face the Nation   on Sunday , saying it would extend from two months to one year the   breakout   time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb . He said it also allows for the   almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal .     We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb ,   he said . Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , said on   Face the Nation   that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a   new crack at it with a new president that does n't have the baggage of Obama .   And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , who 's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal .   Hillary Clinton would do better . I think everybody on our side , except , maybe , Rand Paul , could do better ,   Graham said .","reference":"netanyahu says third option is   standing firm   to get a better deal .political sparring

{"document":"Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks . It celebrates the completion of Christ 's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection . By dying on Good Friday , Christ atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on Sunday , Christ conquered death . Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate . But , like Christmas with its tree , ornaments and Santa Claus , Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs . Unlike Christmas , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events . And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter ? ( No . ) . Here 's a journey from the Vatican to the Holy Land , around the moon and the Earth 's tilting axis , to Germany and the United States to try to explain the complex holiday called Easter . And you 'll learn to how to color Easter eggs with Kool-Aid . Let 's start at the Vatican . At the Vatican , Holy Week began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in Easter Sunday Mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of Christ 's mortal life . Jesus rode on the back of a donkey into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday where crowds celebrated him as the Messiah and laid down palm branches in his path . But the crowd and the Romans turned on him in the course of the week , according to the Bible , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . Rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray St. Peter 's Square on Sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by Pope Francis . Afterward , the Pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his Urbi et Orbi address . Francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . From Nigeria to South Sudan , Iraq to Ukraine , he expressed hope that violence would end . Francis also does n't put on airs . This week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the Biblical account of a woman , a sinner , washing Jesus ' feet and anointing them with oil . Let 's move on to old Jerusalem , the birthplace of Easter . The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in old Jerusalem unifies the spot where Christ was crucified -- Calvary -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . On Sunday , Catholics and Armenian Christians celebrated the Resurrection there . In the morning , the Latin Patriarch , the Archbishop of Jerusalem , entered the basilica . Then mass was held followed by a procession . But a large group of indigenous Christians did n't join them . It 's not quite Easter yet in the Holy Land for Eastern Orthodox Christians . They 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine Easter 's date by a different calendar than Western Christians -- the Julian calendar . Which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of Easter Sunday . A blood moon appeared in the sky early Saturday , right between Good Friday and Easter Sunday and during Passover . Just a coincidence ? Not completely , because the dates for both Passover -- the Jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in Egypt -- and Easter are determined by moon phases , according to timeanddate.com . Easter 's timing is related to Passover , because Jesus was crucified around then , according to the Bible . Many Jewish holidays , including Passover , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . Since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with Earth 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- Passover 's exact date moves around -- and so does Easter 's . When Christian bishops first convened at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of Easter , so as to fairly reliably pin it to Passover : . It would fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . That 's the day in March when Earth 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . But ... if the full moon fell on Sunday , Easter would be pushed down a week . Confusing ? It got worse . When the West moved from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar , Orthodox Christians stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for Easter . In 1997 , the World Council of Churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . It did n't catch on . But some odd Easter trappings that popped up after the Middle Ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . The bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon . That 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . German immigrants appear to have brought it to North America in the 1700s . German historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . Professor of medicine Georg Franck von Frankenau described in his paper   De ovis paschalibus ,   or   On Easter eggs ,   a custom in the Alsace region involving a bunny and eggs , according to German public television . Some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the Christmas tree . But von Frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in Germany . One common idea : During Lent , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . By the time Easter rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . They had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . Play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . Parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the Easter eggs came from . If you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip . Instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use Kool-Aid , YouTube science geek Grant Thompson suggests . And it appears to work . Just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . They turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . But be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , Thompson warns . That 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it . Happy Easter ! Happy Passover !","reference":"easter is a key event in the christian faith , but where did the easter bunny come from ?why is the date different every year , and what does it have to do with the moon ?","sent-rewriting":"easter is a cornerstone event in the christian faith . christ atoned for the sins of others . holy week began with palm sunday and culminated in easter sunday . jesus rode on the back of a donkey into jerusalem .","ctrl-dec-copy":"christ atoned is a cornerstone event in the christian faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks . the pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his urbi address .","reinforced":"easter is a cornerstone event in the crucifixion and resurrection. easter rode on the back of a donkey into jerusalem on. jesus's. to color easter eggs with kool-aid. western christians. the bunny and. to be celebrating a. of. jesus. the.

{"document":"Police in the Indian city of Malegaon , in the western state of Maharashtra , are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents : Cattle . Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef , authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ` mugshot ' of their cattle and submit it to the police . Along with the photograph , the residents have to give information about their animal 's ` unique features , ' such as the coloring and age of the cow , along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics . Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law . Cows are considered holy and revered by that state 's majority Hindu population .   We are creating a database . If we get an information of a cow slaughter , we can quickly go to the resident 's place and check whether it is there or not   , Mahesh Sawai , Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN .   I believe this will be very effective   So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed . The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon , where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat . The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses . Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years . The slaughter of buffaloes , however , is still permissible . However , beef traders in the country strongly reacted to the decision and called a month-long strike , which ended Wednesday . The traders refused to even slaughter buffaloes and deprive the state of all bovine meat . They have now vowed to file a case in the state 's high court . Red meat lovers were n't too delighted either , arguing the government does n't have a right to interfere in an individual 's personal preference . Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter . Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison , the toughest penalty in the country . Rajnath Singh , India 's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter .","reference":"authorities in the indian city of malegaon have asked

{"document":"The FBI charged a Philadelphia woman on Thursday with trying to travel overseas to fight for ISIS . She 's one of three women arrested this week on terror charges . Two New York women were also taken into custody . An FBI complaint cites numerous social media messages dating back to August 2013 that were sent by Keonna Thomas , 30 , also known as   Young Lioness   and   Fatayat Al Khilafah .   One Twitter message said ,   If we truly knew the realities ... we all would be rushing to join our brothers in the front lines pray ALLAH accept us as shuhada -LSB- martyrs -RSB- .   Another said ,   When you 're a mujahid -LSB- violent jihadi fighter -RSB- your death becomes a wedding .   The FBI said Thomas purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23 . Turkey is known as the easiest place from which to enter Syria and join ISIS . An ISIS manual advises recruits to buy round-trip tickets to vacation spots such as Spain and then purchase tickets for their real destination once they arrive overseas , the FBI said . On March 26 , Thomas purchased a ticket to Barcelona , with a March 29 departure and an April 15 return to the United States , the complaint said . It 's not clear when or where she was arrested . She was charged with knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . She could be sentenced to 15 years in prison . On Thursday , Noelle Velentzas , 28 , and her former roommate , Asia Siddiqui , 31 , were arrested in New York and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States , federal prosecutors said . In the past 18 months , the Justice Department 's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups . Of those cases , 18 allegedly involve support to ISIS .   The terrorist threat is more decentralized , more diffuse , more complicated ,   Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday .

{"document":"Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , YouTube channels , even social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media . It is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating . It is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online . It is not unique to Asia , but it might seem more pronounced if you live there . Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard . But it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly . Let 's look at the legal angle first . Amos Yee , the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail Sunday in Singapore , drew international attention for his anti-Lee Kuan Yew harangue . But jailing critics is not usually the government 's first choice in Singapore . It is part of Lee Kuan Yew 's legacy that the government 's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices . His father has reportedly apologized for his son 's behavior , but the younger Yee could face up to three years in jail . Yee is not unique . Another dissident blogger in Singapore , Roy Ngerng , continues to suffer financial and legal pressure , including the loss of his job , because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state 's Prime Minister , Lee Hsien Loong , of corruption . Ngerng 's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the Central Provident Fund , the government 's compulsory pension program . Yee and Ngerng are two of many . The Committee To Protect Journalists ' file on Singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases , some against politicians , others against citizens simply frustrated with their government . But it is not just Singapore where Internet activity comes under fire : On Monday in Malaysia , with much less of the international attention heaped on Amos Yee , five editors and executives from The Malaysian Insider were arrested over the site 's March 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the Conference of Rulers , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under Islamic law . In deeply Muslim Malaysia , questions of Islamic faith are a third-rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced . By far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them Uighur or Tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism . But in second place in Asia is Vietnam , where CPJ 's most recent prison census showed Vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of December 1 . Add one more in late December , Nguyen Dinh Ngoc , a prominent blogger who was arrested for   law-violating   after police searched his home in southern Ho Chi Minh City on December 27 , and two more in January , Nguyen Quang Lap and Hong Le Tho , arrested on anti-state charges of   abusing democratic freedoms   and you can see the pattern . Because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in Vietnam . Only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in Vietnam , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013 . Both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage . The list could go on , but the reality is that , as CPJ wrote in 2013 , across Asia   governments have curtailed Internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices , including prohibitive laws , heightened surveillance and censorship , and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses .   That is still the policy path being followed by most countries in Asia , and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon . Jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another . Since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online . Because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the Internet , that proportion can be expected to grow . While most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers , Bangladesh has recently become the exception . On Monday , Washiqur Rahman Babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in Bangladesh in the past five weeks . Blogger Avijit Roy and his wife , Rafida Ahmed Bonna , were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka . Roy , a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin , was killed and his wife was critically injured . Both Rahman and Roy had written critically on Islamic matters . The blogger death toll gets higher in Bangladesh if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity . In January 2013 , blogger Asif Mohiuddin , who wrote critical commentary on religion , Islamist groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by Islamists . In February 2013 , blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider , who had written about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups , was hacked to death by members of an Islamist militant group , according to police investigations . Later in 2013 , Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy . While arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions . The bottom line : Online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors . Where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom . Where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .","reference":"going online has become the path of least resistance if

{"document":"Atlanta   Robert Lewis Burns Jr. , the original drummer in Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd , died Friday night in a car crash , a Georgia State Patrol spokesman said . Burns , 64 , died after his car hit a mailbox and a tree in Cartersville , spokesman James Tallent said . No other cars were involved in the crash , which occurred shortly before midnight .   He was not restrained at the time of the crash ,   Tallent told CNN . The musician lived in northern Georgia . Burns was part of the genre-defining band 's original lineup , which formed in Jacksonville , Florida , in 1965 . Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant started Noble Five with Burns , guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins and bassist Larry Junstrom in their hometown . It then made a name change in a reference to a high school gym teacher . Lynyrd Skynyrd changed members over the years as it produced rock anthems including   Sweet Home Alabama   and   Freebird .   Burns left the band before its third studio album ,   Nuthin Fancy ,   in 1975 ,   exhausted by touring ,   according to the band 's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography . He was not involved in the 1977 plane crash that killed three members , including Van Zant . The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 . Lynyrd Skynyrd still tours with Rossington , the only original member still in the band .   Today I 'm at a loss for words but I just remember Bob being a funny guy ,   Rossington said on the band 's official Facebook page .   My heart goes out to his family and God bless him and them in this sad time . He was a great great drummer .

{"document":"Atlanta   It was a scene worthy of any top cop show on TV -- bullets flying , banged-up cars and the FBI chasing an armed robbery suspect . In the end , two agents were injured in a crash and the suspect was shot before being captured . FBI agents and task force officers were following 36-year-old Kevone Charleston of Austell , Georgia , as he pulled into a CVS pharmacy in Forsyth County , Georgia , early Saturday . Charleston is suspected of involvement in 32 commercial robberies dating to November 2013 , according to FBI officials .   The incident all happened around 7 o'clock Saturday morning ,   said FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett .   There were multiple agents and officers that were following him based on his prior MO , and when they saw he was about to rob another CVS , they moved in .   Authorities say Charleston parked his vehicle nearby and then popped the hood as if there were something wrong . Then he walked to the CVS , preparing to enter . When agents confronted him , Charleston ran , got in his car and traveled about 75 yards as agents opened fire .   There were several FBI vehicles that were rammed or were hit by the suspect 's vehicle when he was trying to flee . One government vehicle sustained heavy damage to its front and side , and another government SUV ended up on its side . That 's how the two agents sustained their injuries ,   Emmett said . Twelve FBI agents and six government vehicles followed Charleston . Emmett said Charleston   was trying to get away , our agents were trying to stop him . He collided with the first government vehicle , the Taurus , then the second , and the SUV ended on its side .   The perp was stopped 8 feet away in the median , and that 's where he received his gunshot wounds .   The two agents were treated at an area hospital and released , according to Emmett , who says   they are fine .   Charleston was shot and wounded by FBI agents and task force officers , but his injuries are not life threatening , according to Forsyth County Sheriff 's Deputy Robin Regan . Although he declined to give details of the 32 previous robberies , Emmett said it was an intensive investigation that was already underway as a priority for the FBI 's violent crimes and major offender squad . He added ,   His MO involved armed confrontations , so our officers went into this fully prepared for an armed confrontation based on his past history .   Emmett says he 's relieved that the FBI 's officers and agents are OK and that the suspect is in custody . He said it was the   conclusion of an intensive and lengthy investigation .

{"document":"After years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the NCAA now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . On its website , the NCAA prominently states ,   It 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed .   And later , it says that   in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second .   But the NCAA is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes . The lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in NCAA history . In its response , the NCAA says it has no legal responsibility   to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions .   Even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the NCAA has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , NCAA attorneys wrote in this court filing that   the NCAA did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes ,   and   the NCAA does not have ` direct , day-to-day , operational control '   over member institutions like UNC .   It 's nonsense . It 's double talk ,   said Gerald Gurney , a former athletic-academic director who is now president of The Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport .   If you look at their basic core principles , it 's all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount ,   Gurney said .   They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths .   The NCAA referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : . The NCAA believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the NCAA 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the NCAA has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field .   This case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the NCAA to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them ,   said Donald Remy , NCAA chief legal officer . In its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately . The scandal at UNC involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports . Mary Willingham , the UNC whistleblower turned NCAA critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required . The system of eligibility that the NCAA brags about , she says , is a sham .   Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? It makes no sense ,   said Willingham , who recently wrote a book about the UNC scandal called   Cheated .     If they ca n't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play ? It 's lost its meaning for me .   The NCAA 's claim that it 's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , Mark Emmert , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . For example , before it lost a case filed by former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the NCAA stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education . That 's the defense the NCAA is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value . In response , the NCAA said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : Consistent with   its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with NCAA bylaws .   Attorney Michael Hausfeld , who represented both O'Bannon and now the UNC athletes , said this : .   This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the NCAA 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes . NCAA President Mark Emmert has repeatedly proposed that ` What we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the NCAA 's record tells a far different story .   But Rick Burton , professor of sport management at Syracuse University , said it 's not realistic to think that the NCAA would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country .   I understand , I think , where the NCAA is coming from . We would not let the NCAA come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at Syracuse University ,   he said .   It sounds like someone is trying to say the NCAA should have been supervising that department at the University of North Carolina , and there 's no logic to that ,   he said .   The people who are saying the NCAA should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the NCAA .   UNC , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the   educational malpractice   theory does n't apply . UNC claims it is protected by state law . This is reminiscent of another NCAA reversal . The NCAA , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from   dangerous and exploitive athletic practices ,   now says it does not enforce health and safety rules . In fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the NCAA wrote :   The NCAA denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes .   A CNN investigation found that the NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken . It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL . Ramogi Huma , president of the National College Players Association , and a leading thorn in the NCAA 's side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the NCAA leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all .   There 's nothing left the NCAA can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society . One has to wonder what does the NCAA do if it does n't protect players ? If it does n't play a role in the education of college athletics ? It begs the question of why does the NCAA exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption .","reference":"in response to lawsuit , ncaa says it does n't control quality of education for student-athletes

{"document":"The world 's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this . The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two-year shutdown . After problems that delayed the restart in March , scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC 's 17 mile ( 27 km ) ring .   Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN 's here for ,   CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization 's website .   Today , CERN 's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC .   The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles ( more than 10 billion kilometers ) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again . At near light-speed , a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second . It took thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator , housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range . The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the   Big Bang   -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe . By replicating the energy density and temperature , scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved . Our current , limited , knowledge is based on what 's called The Standard Model of particle physics .   But we know that this model is not complete ,   Dr. Mike Lamont , operations group leader at the LHC , told CNN in March . The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy , while others have no mass at all ; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity ; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy , since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe . The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter , despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang . CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature . The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros ( about $ 3.3 billion ) , paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations . The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive . Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown .   After two years of effort , the LHC is in great shape ,   said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology , Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Bordry .   But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels .   Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report .","reference":"the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- begins again after a two-year shutdown .the restart was delayed in march .","sent-rewriting":"the

{"document":"Residents of central Sanaa , the Yemeni capital , have learned the hard way that key strategic bombing targets are located in their neighborhoods : Detonating ordnance has been shattering their windows and doors . And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks . The Saudi-led coalition smashed parts of Yemen 's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend , senior Yemeni officials said . Under the rain of coalition bombs , the Houthis , who are Shiites in a majority Sunni country , still control Sanaa . But the airstrikes have hurt them and destroyed a lot of infrastructure . The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas , the Yemeni officials said . Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well . Yemen 's deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes . He fired his former Army chief of staff , Hussein Khairan , on Sunday . The firing had no practical effect , since Khairan had switched sides weeks ago and is the Houthi rebels ' acting defense minister . Hadi is holed up in Saudi Arabia , which is working to defeat his enemies and reinstall him . Fighting has ended dozens of lives each day . On Monday , more than 50 people died in the port city of Aden alone , where Houthis and their allies are battling troops loyal to Hadi on the ground , Agence France-Press reported . Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago , some 600 people are estimated to have been killed . Many more have been wounded , and tens of thousands have fled the country . The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in .   Otherwise , put starkly , many more people will die . For the wounded , their chances of survival depend on action within hours , not days ,   said Robert Mardini , the ICRC 's head of operations in the Near and Middle East .   Medical supplies need to be here yesterday ,   said ICRC spokeswoman Marie-Claire Feghali from Sanaa .   We need to save the lives that can be saved .   Saudi Arabia signed off on letting the ICRC into Yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies , the other with workers . But flying in will be hard , since most airlines have canceled their flights , and airstrikes have taken out many airfields . On Monday , the flight loaded with 48 tons of medical supplies was grounded in Djibouti , Feghali said . The ICRC is hoping to fly out in a day or two . Following the ICRC 's call , on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia 's behest . Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition . The meeting adjourned with no decision announced . One diplomat said the draft was missing key elements . It did n't call for the Houthis to stop fighting or for political talks between the belligerents , the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity . Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Hadi from power . The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January . But Hadi escaped in February , fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president . Houthis and their allies , including those loyal to Hadi 's predecessor , then fought Hadi 's forces in the Aden area . Hadi fled Aden in late March , ultimately for Saudi Arabia , when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city . The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia , a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen 's northern neighbor , and other Arab nations to intervene with force . The Houthis are allied with Iran , Saudi Arabia 's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf , and Riyadh does not want an proxy of Iran in power on its border . Complicating matters in Yemen is the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or the forces loyal to Hadi -- holds sway in the country 's east . AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization . It has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail . Hadi 's government had cooperated with the United States to fight AQAP , but with the Houthi takeover , that arrangement has evaporated , and the terror group operates generally unchecked

{"document":"The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion , especially in Indiana , where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people . Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993 , designed to prohibit the federal government from   substantially burdening   a person 's exercise of religion . So far , 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law , and the legal controversies have grown , too . Nonetheless , claims under those state RFRAs are   exceedingly rare ,   and victories involved mostly religious minorities , not Christian denominations , experts say .   There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers ,   wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis , when there were only 16 states with such laws . Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws , touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon : . He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes . But not in the eyes of the feds . In 2006 , Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers , in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act , which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground . Soto , a Lipan Apache , asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony . The feathers are sacred to Native Americans . But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe was n't federally recognized , and Soto surrendered his feathers . Russell , who is married to Soto 's sister , is n't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine , according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal . Soto , however , petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers . The feds said no , because he was n't from a recognized tribe . Soto and Russell sued the federal government , but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government , rejecting the two men 's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act , the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law . But last August , the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court 's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government 's action would violate the federal RFRA . On March 10 , the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto . But the legal war is n't over . The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants , so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction , claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA , said Luke Goodrich , Soto 's attorney who 's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty . A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion , but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug . The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca , made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine , a hallucinogen , in violation of the Controlled Substances Act . The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions . About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion . In May 1999 , U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe , New Mexico , and seized all of its hoasca . The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug , peyote , in their religious ceremonies . In fact , the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans ' use of peyote , said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .   They were a legitimate religion , and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion , and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected ,   Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law . The Uniao do Vegetal , which means   the union of the plants ,   cited that federal law in suing the federal government .   The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church 's use of peyote ( which contains mescaline , also a controlled substance ) but can not accommodate the UDV 's use of hoasca ,   the church said in a statement . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church 's favor , saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use .   The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government 's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA ,   the court ruling said . Bruce Rich , an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida , wanted kosher meals , but the warden said no . So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010 , saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 , a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law . Rich , 66 , is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents , in their 70s , in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home . The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns , namely   retaliation against the kosher inmates   if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food , court papers said . At least 35 other states and the federal government , however , provided kosher diets to inmates . After losing before a magistrate , Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court , which cited   the defendant 's meager efforts to explain why Florida 's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida .   Recently baptized in the Sikh faith , Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item : a 9-inch kirpan , a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved . Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith . But the federal government banned her from the building , citing the kirpan as a   dangerous weapon   with a more than 3-inch blade , and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace . Tagore sued the government under the federal law . Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects : real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes , said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund . Also , federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives . In November , the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore 's trial . The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing , the Christian Science Monitor reported . Tagore 's attorneys described the settlement as   a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings ,   they said in a statement . Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes does n't always equate to victory . In Chicago , an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones . The ministers needed a special use permit , but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one , the church leaders claimed . In fact , it was easier to get a club , lodge or community center approved . So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000 , alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute , the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution . But in 2003 , the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group 's claims , finding no substantial burden on the churches , which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim . Defeated , church leaders were angry .   The forty ( 40 ) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000 ,   Apostle Theodore Wilkinson , the group 's chairman , said in a statement .   Also alarming is the court 's conclusion that Chicago 's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws . The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing ,   he said . At the same time , the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid   the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA ,   according to a League of California Cities report in 2002 . CNN 's Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report .","reference":"a native american from a tribe not recognized by the feds wins the return of his eagle feathers .an irs accountant is fired for

{"document":"The terrorist group Al-Shabaab has claimed an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast . Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in Kenya , the most well-known of them being the massacre at the Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi in 2013 . Cross-border raids into Kenya by the group , however , date back to 2011 . Al-Shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in Nairobi , which sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union mission in support of Somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from Al-Shabaab and other militants for several years . Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS ( also known as Islamic State ) , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support . Its origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami ( Unity of Islam ) , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of Siad Barre in 1991 . These disparate groups fought each other and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later . Al-Shabaab ( literally   the Youth   ) split from Unity of Islam in 2003 and merged with another radical Islamist group , the so-called Islamic Courts Union . As their alliance obtained control of Somalia 's capital Mogadishu in 2006 , Ethiopia , the only majority Christian country in the region , took military action against the group . The offensive weakened Al-Shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern Somalia , but it failed to defeat it . To the contrary , Ethiopia 's invasion and occupation of parts of Somalia -- although invited by the Somali government and backed by the African Union -- enabled Al-Shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an Islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign   Christian   invasion . Initially , the group primarily attacked Ethiopian forces , but soon began to   expand   its activities against the Somali government as well . The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010 . Soon after this , cross-border raids in Kenya began , predominantly targeting Christians there . Increasing its links with al-Qaeda , Al-Shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to ISIS . Much will depend on how the relationships between al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , a long-time ally of Al-Shabaab based in Yemen , and ISIS develop . The key point is that Al-Shabaab 's attack in Garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors . It must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism . Clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of Islam . But the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance . These entrenched inequalities help Al-Shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons . Attacking a university in northern Kenya and separating Christian from Muslim students epitomizes the way Al-Shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities . Ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources . As long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests . It is important to counter Al-Shabaab directly , including by military means . But there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by Al-Shabaab . As Garissa shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit . Copyright 2015 The Conversation .

{"document":"A Connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being , according to her attorney , Josh Michtom . A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen , identified in court documents as   Cassandra C. ,   go home . The judge also denied a motion for visitation . The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments . On March 16 , Michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother 's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness . Michtom and attorney Michael Taylor , who represents Cassandra 's mother , Jackie Fortin , released a written statement after receiving the judge 's decision Wednesday :   We are disappointed in this ruling , not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence . We 're conferring with our clients now about next steps , including whether to take another appeal .   Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy . Without it , doctors said at the time , she was likely to die within two years . She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days , according to court documents , when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body . In December , a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families . At that time , she was admitted to Connecticut Children 's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then . Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them . Cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned , according to Michtom .   She 's seen in her case the side effects were n't bad , and she 's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment ,   he said . Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month . Michtom and Taylor failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions . Joette Katz , the commissioner of the Department of Children and Families , told CNN in March the agency is   very pleased with Cassandra 's progress toward a complete recovery . We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life .   The agency has denied CNN 's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians . According to Michtom , the Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but has n't . He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before . Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she 'll be allowed to return home . So for now , Cassandra is said to spend her days reading , watching TV and drawing .   The hospital is effectively jail ,   Michtom said .","reference":"judge wo n't allow teen leave hospital before her last chemotherapy treatment .attorneys for the teen are deciding whether to appeal

' be the Hot 100 's No. 1 Song of 2015 ? With   Funk   now just three weeks from potentially tying   One Sweet Day   for the record , and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself , can it rewrite Hot 100 history ? It 's too early to forecast charts a month away , but   Funk   still sports strong leads in all main Hot 100 metrics .   Funk   logs a 13th week atop the Digital Songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold ( down 12 percent ) in the week ending March 29 , according to Nielsen Music . That 's a record-tying feat :   Funk !   matches Flo Rida 's 2007-08 hit   Low ,   featuring T-Pain , for the most weeks a title has spent at No. 1 on Digital Songs .   Funk   also leads Streaming Songs ( 16.2 million U.S. streams , down 15 percent ) for an 11th week . On Radio Songs ,   Funk   reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all-format audience ( down 4 percent ) . It 's the first song to reach double-digit weeks at No. 1 on Radio Songs since   Blurred Lines   led for 11 . Ask Billboard : Will ` Uptown Funk ! ' Be the Hot 100 's No. 1 Song of 2015 ?   Funk ,   thus , leads the Hot 100 and its three main component charts ( Digital Songs , Radio Songs and Streaming Songs ) simultaneously for a record-extending ninth week ( nonconsecutively ) . Perhaps helping the chances that   Funk   can remain at No. 1 on the Hot 100 , at least for another week : while it 's down by 11 percent in overall activity , the No. 2 song ( for a third week ) , Maroon 5 's   Sugar ,   decreases by 3 percent , while Ed Sheeran 's   Thinking Out Loud ,   at No. 3 ( for a third week , after peaking at No. 2 for eight weeks ) , is off by 2 percent . And , the lead of   Funk   over those songs is still significant : they each boast approximately two-thirds of the Hot 100 points of   Funk   this week . Could either   Sugar   or   Loud   rebound to challenge   Funk   further on the Hot 100 ? Could another song in the top 10 topple it ? Or , is it a song just building , or not even yet released , that will take over ? Again , it 's too soon to tell . We know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that   Funk   has become . ( At least we think one will ... ) . Chart Highlights : Taylor Swift 's ` Style ' hits No. 1 on adult pop songs . Meanwhile ,   Sugar   takes over at No. 1 on the subscription services-based On-Demand Songs chart , despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams . (   Funk   falls to No. 3 on the list after 11 weeks at No. 1 . )   Sugar   holds at No. 2 on Digital Songs ( 143,000 , down 8 percent ) ; rises 4-2 on Radio Songs ( 133 million , up 3 percent ) ; and keeps at No. 4 on Streaming Songs ( 9.5 million , down 4 percent ) . Below Sheeran , Ellie Goulding 's   Love Me Like You Do   holds at No. 4 on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 3 . The Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack single dips 3-4 on Digital Songs ( 114,000 , down 14 percent ) and stays at No. 5 on Radio Songs ( 118 million , up 8 percent ) and Streaming Songs ( 9 million , up 9 percent ) . From the same hit movie , The Weeknd 's   Earned It ( Fifty Shades of Grey )   reaches the Hot 100 's top five ( 6-5 ) , adding top Airplay Gainer honors for a second week . On Radio Songs , it pushes 9-6 with a 23 percent gain to 86 million .   Earned   ( a possible contender for No. 1 on the Hot 100 ... ) holds at No. 6 on both Streaming Songs ( 8.9 million , up 24 percent ) and Digital Songs ( 107,000 , up 4 percent ) . The sultry track also takes over at No. 1 on Billboard 's Hot R&B \/ Hip-Hop Songs chart . Chart Highlights : Taylor Swift 's ` Style ' Hits No. 1 on Adult Pop Songs .

{"document":"Seoul , South Korea   The man accused of stabbing U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in Seoul last month is now charged with attempted murder , a South Korean court official said Wednesday . Kim Ki-Jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction , the Seoul Central District Court official said . According to South Korean law , Kim 's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today 's indictment . Lippert was stabbed March 5 during an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation , which advocates peaceful reunification between North and South Korea . Shortly before Lippert was supposed to give a speech , the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw . The ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches . That wound measured 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) long and 2.5 centimeters ( 1 inch ) deep , but there was no serious facial nerve damage , said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital . Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand , but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function . Police said Kim stabbed Lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills , which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of North Korea . Police official Yoon Myeong-seong told reporters that Kim had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007 , and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against Lippert . Kim , 55 , has a history of unpredictable behavior . In 2010 , he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea , according to the Yonhap news agency . South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack .   This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador ,   she said ,   but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated .

{"document":"President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president . Reaching a good , solid agreement with Iran is a worthy , desirable goal . But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening America 's hand and strengthening Iran . Obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it . There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months . The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations . The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. Few believe it , particularly in the Middle East and notably among America 's Arab friends , who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the United States and outplayed Obama . As the writer David Rothkopf aptly put it ,   Iran is having a great Obama administration .   That 's a belief that has already started shaking up the region . Saudi Arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes Iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among Iran 's Muslim rivals will do the same . In fact , the notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen , where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran 's allies . We can trace it all back to the Democratic primaries in 2007 , when then-Sen . Obama said he would meet Iran 's leaders   without preconditions ,   leading his rival , Hillary Clinton , to call the idea   Irresponsible and frankly naive .   As the years of his presidency unfolded , and the Middle East started coming apart , finding a deal with Iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement Obama might leave behind . The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace . The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama 's March 31 deadline . The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States , and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a   bad tactic .   That bad tactic was a political move , a push to produce some sort of result , however vague , to protect the talks from critics . Again , a solid agreement that ensures Iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development . But the agreement so far does not look promising . It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what Obama had vowed . In a presidential debate in 2012 , Obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations .   The deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . It 's very straightforward .   Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program . Not even close . Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges . That 's not a small symbolic number . And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled , although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials . Iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses . The fact is that Iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U.N. inspectors . And the U.N. agency chief says that has not stopped . A couple of weeks ago , with days left until the negotiating deadline , U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano said Iran is still stonewalling .   We are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is -LSB- for a -RSB- peaceful purpose ,   he warned . The negotiations ' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably , forever . The world only learned about Iran 's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm . Iran , we have learned repeatedly , is very good at lying to international inspectors . It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program . It is well-established that many of Iran 's neighbors do n't trust it and are anxious about the U.S.-led international dealings with Iran . It is well-established that Iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region . It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring Iran to the negotiating table . It was Iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks . But political considerations turned the United States into the supplicant . The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon . Nuclear enrichment will continue , although at a lower level . Iran officially , legally , becomes a nuclear threshold state , with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a   breakout   period of one year , the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act . Even the Fordow facility , conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain , will remain in existence , though   converted   to a nuclear   research facility   And without nuclear material on site . International sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately . Its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place , even if operating at a reduced pace , giving Iran much of what it wanted . With Iranian forces gaining ground in Arab lands and Iranian commanders declaring the destruction of Israel   nonnegotiable   and threatening Saudi Arabia , this deal does not look reassuring . Obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option . But the deal so far looks like ( another ) win for Iran . It introduces enough restrictions that it could give the President the political cover he wants , but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the Middle East .","reference":"frida ghitis : president barack obama is right to want a deal , but this one gives iran too much .she says the framework agreement starts

{"document":"Blue Bell ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant . Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company 's Broken Arrow , Oklahoma , plant . That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O , P , Q , R , S or T behind the coding date . The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream , including other 3-ounce servings , not made at the plant . But Blue Bell has recalled other products . The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility   out of an abundance of caution   to search for a possible cause of contamination . It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company 's ice cream . Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital . The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014 , Blue Bell said . And , according to the CDC , listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant . The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically , the CDC said . But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak . In a separate outbreak in Texas , the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples . None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections .   Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing ,   the CDC said . In early March , in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak , Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas . It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall . Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products , according to the CDC . All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis , the CDC said . At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection .   We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this ,   Paul Kruse , Blue Bell CEO and president , said in a statement .   Quality and safety have always been our top priorities . We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected .   The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away . In a statement on its website , Blue Bell said   this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons , pints , quarts , 3 gallons or other 3 oz . cups .   This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries , the company said . Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , and primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the CDC . Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches , sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms . In the United States , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year , and approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death . Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters . CNN 's Debra Goldschmidt , Amanda Watts and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report .","reference":"a test in kansas finds listeria in a blue bell ice cream cup .the company announces it is

{"document":"When Hong Kong police answered a call in the early hours of a Saturday morning last November , they encountered a grisly scene and an alleged crime that shocked the city . One woman was lying on the floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks . Another was stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony . A former banker , 29-year-old Briton Rurik Jutting , was charged with two counts of murder . On Thursday , a court hearing that was to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed to trial was adjourned until May . Here 's what we know so far about the victims and their alleged attacker . Jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene , an upmarket apartment in the middle of Wan Chai , an inner-city suburb that 's home to an eclectic mix of late-night bars , residential tower blocks and local markets selling groceries and assorted cheap goods . In the early hours of Saturday morning , November 1 , police say Jutting called them to the apartment . There they found a woman lying on the blood-splattered floor , later identified as 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih . During a search of the apartment , officers uncovered another body hidden in a suitcase on the balcony . It 's alleged 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih was killed on October 27 , five days before her body was found . Sumarti Ningsih was from Cilacap , in Central Java , and was the mother of a five-year-old girl . In a statement , her cousin , Jumiati , described her as   just an ordinary woman from Indonesia   who , like many others , was   forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream comes ( sic ) true .     She wanted to work as professional so she can earn money and dignity for her family ,   Jumiati wrote .   She is good girl and did not deserve this treatment .   According to the Asian Migrant Coordinating Body , Ningsih was visiting Hong Kong as a tourist and had been due to fly back to Jakarta the day after her body was found . Last year , her grieving father , Ahmad Khaliman , told Agence France-Presse that his daughter had worked in Hong Kong as a domestic helper between 2011 and 2013 . She 'd since returned on two occasions , Khaliman said . He said the family had been shocked by her murder , and called for the perpetrator to be executed .   If not , I can not accept it . He has already taken my daughter 's life , so he has to pay with his life ,   he told CNN affiliate Trans7 . Seneng Mujiasih had more recently worked as a domestic worker in Hong Kong but had overstayed her visa , according to the Asian Migrant Co-ordinating Body . Also known as Jesse Lorena , Mujiasih was from the city of Muna in Sulawesi province , in southeast Indonesia . Other than that , few details are known about her life and why she stayed on in Hong Kong . After news of their death spread , fellow domestic workers held a vigil in Hong Kong 's Victoria Park . Around 200 people gathered to sing and pray , and lay flowers besides photos of the two women . The victims ' bodies were buried after being repatriated to Indonesia in November . Before being taken into custody , Rurik Jutting lived in the upmarket J Residence in Wan Chai . He was detained at the scene , where police found the bodies of two women and seized a knife during a search of the premises . It 's unclear when Jutting left his job as a trader at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch ; a BoA spokesman would only confirm that a man of the same name had worked there in the past . Jutting 's profile on LinkedIn said he haad been employed at the bank 's structured equity finance and trading division in Hong Kong since July 2013 . Before that , he worked in the same unit in London for three years . According to the profile , Jutting previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge , between 2004 and 2008 . As part of the trial process , tests were conducted to determined if Jutting was psychologically fit to enter a plea . He was . The case was then adjourned to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed .","reference":"hong kong banker alleged murder case adjourned until may .the 29-year-old rurik jutting is accused of killing two indonesian domestic workers .","sent-rewriting":"hong kong police answered a call in the early hours of a saturday morning . one woman was lying on floor with cuts to her neck and buttocks . former banker rurik jutting was charged with two counts of murder . it 's alleged 25-year-old sumarti ningsih was killed on october 27 .","ctrl-dec-copy":"hong kong police answered call in early hours of saturday morning last november . former banker rurik jutting charged with two counts of murder . jutting chai , mother of five-year-old girl , was killed on october 27 .","reinforced":"hong kong police say hong kong police answered a call in the early hours of a saturday last november. the briton rurik jutting allegedly lived at the murder scene. rurik jutting. was charged with two counts of murder. on.

{"document":"Universal 's   Furious 7   continues to build momentum at the Friday box office for a weekend debut in the $ 135 million - $ 138 million range , the largest opening in North America since fall 2013 . That includes a projected Friday take of $ 58 million - $ 60 million . The final film featuring the late Paul Walker ,   Furious 7   is opening around the globe this weekend and earned a record-breaking $ 60 million internationally on Wednesday and Thursday for a possible worldwide debut approaching or crossing $ 300 million by the end of Easter Sunday .   Furious 7   is getting the widest release in Universal 's history . Domestically , it will be playing in 4,003 theaters by Good Friday . Internationally , it has booked more than 10,500 screens in 63 territories , although it wo n't open in China , Japan and Russia until later . The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is   Captain America : The Winter Soldier ,   which debuted to $ 95 million from 3,928 theaters last year .   Furious 7   is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date . And it will easily beat the $ 121.9 million launch of   The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1   in November 2104 , making it the largest three-day opening since   The Hunger Games : Catching Fire   ( $ 158 million ) in November 2013 . The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest , due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker 's death . The last film ,   Fast & Furious 6 ,   debuted to a franchise-best $ 117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012 , including $ 97.4 million for the three days , on its way to grossing $ 788.7 million worldwide . Universal intended to open   Furious 7   on July 11 , 2014 , but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus . After director James Wan , writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script , production resumed in April 2014 . CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker 's detective character , Brian O'Conner , with Walker 's brothers , Caleb and Cody , used as stand-ins .   Furious 7   pits Vin Diesel 's Dominic Toretto and crew ( which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson , among others , as well as Walker ) against Jason Statham 's Deckard Shaw , out for revenge after the death of his brother . Dwayne Johnson also reprises his role as Hobbs . \u00a9 2015 The Hollywood Reporter .

Her lawyers describe it as   the medical diagnosis given to individuals whose gender identity -- their innate sense of being male or female -- differs from the sex they were assigned at birth , causing clinically significant distress .   Last year , a Kansas judge granted her request to be formally known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning . The former Army intelligence analyst was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history .

{"document":"According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors ,   ( a ) n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia .   The Columbia team concluded that   The failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact-checking .   Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication . The magazine 's managing editor , Will Dana , wrote ,   We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout , including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students .   Brian Stelter : Fraternity to ` pursue all available legal action ' The next question is : . Can UVA , Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation ? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that   the elements of libel are ( 1 ) publication of ( 2 ) an actionable statement with ( 3 ) the requisite intent .     Actionable   means the statement must be both false and defamatory . Of course , the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , but also the Virginia Constitution . True statements can not be defamatory . Neither can pure statements of opinion , because they theoretically can not be either true or false . But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact , and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers   true .   The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals , and not public figures ; the latter have a harder time proving defamation . A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person 's reputation . The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false , or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis , or acted negligently in checking the facts . At first blush , that sounds like it fits perfectly , right ? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent . But that 's only half the battle . There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this . The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters . First , let 's eliminate UVA . The university is a public university , and therefore it is a governmental entity . The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government : The government can not sue for defamation . There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence . Now the fraternities , starting with Phi Kappa Psi . A fraternity is not an individual , but a group . A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were   of or concerning   the plaintiff . It sounds obvious , but if you 're going to say a statement hurt you , you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with . When the statements are about a group without naming an individual , it 's hard to say the statement is   concerning   the individual -- and groups generally can not sue . For example , you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief , but that same person can not sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves . Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group 's individual members , for the most part . Like all rules , however , there are exceptions . If the defamatory language is about   a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group , an individual member may sue .   If I said ,   The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals   ( they were n't ) , the individual players could sue , because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I did n't . Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the   small group   exception fits it perfectly : Even if the individual members were not identified by name , the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members , who have suffered by their association with the group . On the other hand , Rolling Stone 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid ( after all , the membership changes somewhat every year ) , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury . As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit . Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed . That 's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm . So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter , you 're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially . And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on Facebook live in their moms ' basements and are   between jobs ,   these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place . The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case . The university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases .","reference":"an outside review found that a rolling stone article about campus rape was   deeply flawed  danny cevallos says that there

{"document":"The classic video game   Space Invaders   was developed in Japan back in the late 1970 's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan 's corridors of power . Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space .   When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation ,   Nakatani said . He continued :   They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth .   Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as   among the most respected men in sports-entertainment   -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's   basketball diplomacy   by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

{"document":"The FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January . Marwan , whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir , was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah 's central command . The FBI said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern Philippines showed a link with a known relative of Marwan . But the FBI now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted Islamic extremist .   After a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our Philippine law enforcement partners , the FBI has assessed that terrorism subject , Zulkifli Abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the FBI 's list of Most Wanted Terrorists ,   David Bowdich , assistant director in charge of the FBI 's Los Angeles field office , told CNN in a statement . The FBI had been offering a $ 5 million reward for information leading to Marwan 's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court . It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations , and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups , including the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf . Marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by Philippine security forces in 2012 . The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years , and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , the largest rebel group in the region . But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of Marwan at Mamapasono , in the southern province of Maguindanao . The mission went disastrously awry . Forty-four members of the police 's elite Special Action Force ( SAF ) unit were killed in the assault , targeting an area controlled by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters ( BIFF ) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the Philippines government . According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict ( IPAC ) last month , the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS . In the immediate aftermath of the assault , the SAF company charged with executing Marwan came under fire , before another SAF company stationed in nearby MILF territory as a   blocking force   became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with MILF fighters . According to the IPAC report , the SAF   blocking   company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived , . Eighteen MILF fighters were killed and a number of BIFF fighters may also died . The clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the MILF , authorities said . A national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest . Bowdich expressed the FBI 's   sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive .   While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines . The IPAC report argued that the   single-minded focus   of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress .   The best chance the southern Philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy ,   read the report , which argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan . The report argued that , although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf , he was not   the master bomber that his reputation suggested .   Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies , killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target . The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan 's who described the Malaysian as   a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon .

{"document":"One of Tokyo 's most prominent districts has taken a small , but potentially significant step to recognizing same-sex unions in Japan . The government of Shibuya ward , one of the capital 's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts , passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for   partnership certificates   for same-sex couples , allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples . Same-sex partners who are registered with the district 's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements . Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy , such as joint filing of taxes , are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities . The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya 's mayor , Toshitake Kuwahara . While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding , proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward 's decision is a step in the right direction .   It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing ,   Gon Matsunaka , a gay rights activist , told CNN . While Shibuya 's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage , the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities .   What is important for the LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society ,   Matsunaka said .   It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems LGBT people are facing .   Taiga Ishikawa , Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan , told CNN the ordinance was a   big first step for the protection of human rights .   He called the decision   happy   but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles . He said that the most important part of today 's announcement is that it   should be actually put into practice , as should education for understanding ( LGBT individuals ) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young .   Neighboring Setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following Shibuya 's lead . However , former councilor Ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement 's momentum for granted .   To realize equal rights for gay couples , a national law has to be made ,   he said . While outright discrimination against the LGBT community is rare in Japan , its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage . Many hide their sexuality from their employers , co-workers , families and friends . But the tide may be turning . A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4 % oppose gay marriage , but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70 % . An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper , which commissioned the poll , welcomed the Shibuya decision , calling it   a bold and important step forward .   Only traditional marriages are recognized under Japan 's constitution , but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation , according to Mari Miura , a professor of gender and politics at Sophia University in Tokyo .   The constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage , so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional ,   Miura told Bloomberg Business . While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party   do n't like the idea of same-sex marriage , but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum .   Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition , with one , known as the Network Pushing for Normalization of Education , telling the Japan Times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other Japanese citizens would degrade the   familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history .   While Shibuya 's registration system will be a first for Japan , Yodogawa ward in the western Japanese city of Osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the LGBT community . In 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced , and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to LGBT individuals . Journalist Chie Kobayashi contributed reporting from Tokyo .","reference":"shibuya ward in tokyo passes an ordinance that gives same-sex couples some of the rights of married heterosexual couples

{"document":"Hong Kong   Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China 's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire , provincial authorities told state media . The plant , located in Zhangzhou city , produces paraxylene ( PX ) , a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics . The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak , though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill . Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment , Xinhua news agency reported . More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control , the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning . Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire . One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors . The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013 , although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time . Though demonstrations are illegal in China , the construction of PX plants has sparked protests , which have occasionally turned violent , in several cities in recent years . The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country . However , it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current , more remote location .","reference":"a blast rocks

{"document":"The presence of a harmful pesticide at a luxury villa in the U.S. Virgin Islands may have resulted in the illness of a Delaware family , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday . Paramedics were called last week to a rented villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John after the family of four fell ill . They had rented the villa from March 14 to March 22 , and were later hospitalized . The illness was reported to the EPA on March 20 .   Our preliminary results do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying ,   said Elias Rodriguez , an EPA spokesman . Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects , including central nervous system and respiratory system damage , according to the EPA . The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity . It 's not allowed to be used indoors . Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings .   It 's an ongoing investigation ; we 're still on the island doing our assessment ,   Rodriguez said .   We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling .   Final test results were expected next week . The EPA is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated .   Pesticides can be very toxic , and it is critically important that they be applied properly and used only as approved by EPA ,   said Judith A. Enck , a regional administrator for the EPA .   The EPA is actively working to determine how this happened and will make sure steps are taken to prevent this from happening to others at these vacation apartments or elsewhere .   Depending on the season , the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $ 550 and $ 1,200 per night . Sea Glass Vacations , which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa , said that the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests , but that their unit was not treated . The company said it licensed an outside company , Terminix , for the pest control services .   Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services ,   the company said in a statement . The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter , according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings , the parent company of Terminix . In an email to CNN , a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is   committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers , employees , the public and the environment   and is   looking into this matter internally , and cooperating with authorities .     We 're thinking about the family , and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery ,   Terminix wrote . James Maron , an attorney who has been a spokesman for the family , has not responded to requests for comment . The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as   serious .","reference":"delaware family becomes ill at the sirenusa resort in the u.s. virgin islands .preliminary epa results find

{"document":"When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967 , I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body . Five decades later , I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation . But that is what Rand Paul , who today declared he 's running for president of the United States , is doing . His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about   expanding the Republican Party   -- a message of inclusion . But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include , heard nothing more than hype . I 'm not buying it . Since coming to the U.S. Senate , Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican . He 's tried to brand himself as the GOP 's minority outreach candidate . The problem for Paul , and the GOP at large , is that they do n't back up their words with their policies . Yes , it 's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle . But they ca n't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities . A quick survey of Sen. Paul 's positions makes clear that he does not . Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring   I have a message that is loud and clear : We have come to take our country back .   I have no doubt that under Paul 's leadership , he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act -- which Paul has done since landing on the national stage ; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks   should be done away with ;   when women did n't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington ; when DREAMers were n't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes . In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities , he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency . But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act , and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate . When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court 's dismantling of the law , Paul dismissively remarked ,   We have an African-American President .   When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday , he inspired us all by saying :   With effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity . ... With effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote .   America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy , not less . Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle . Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year . But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated , outside of the mainstream , and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country . The American people deserve a leader who wo n't disrespect their intelligence , who wo n't pander to them when it 's convenient , and who wo n't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades . What I heard today , did n't change the facts about Rand Paul 's record . The American people deserve better than Rand Paul .","reference":"georgia powers : rand paul , running for president , would like minorities to think he 's an advocate . his record on rights shows

{"document":"The United States Department of Justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs , and the charges are serious indeed . A 15-count indictment filed in federal court in California bristles with accusations of conspiracies , transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions , violations of the Controlled Substances Act , misbranding charges , and money laundering charges . Who is this menace to society ? FedEx . Yes , the courier delivery service . Wait , can companies even be charged with crimes ? Where would a FedEx be incarcerated ? Is there a corporate Shawshank Prison ? How does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit ? It turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person . It 's a practice the Supreme Court has approved of for over a century . In fact , in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people . Corporations do n't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes . Imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive , but corporate convictions , on the other hand , turn tidy profits for the U.S. government , with zero prison overhead . Even if corporations can be held criminally liable , should a courier service like FedEx be held liable for   possessing   what bad guys may send through the service ? The answer , according to FedEx , is not just   No ,   but a   No   so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom . The company maintains that it is innocent . It has a point .   Possession   is an elusive concept . When it comes to drugs , the law recognizes two kinds of possession : actual and constructive . Actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband . When you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket , you   actually   possess those things . The somewhat hazier concept of   constructive possession   means you can   possess   something without even having it on your person , as long as you have ownership , dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found . For example , the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 OxyContin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway , you   constructively   possessed them . Conversely , sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle , but not   possess   it either actually or constructively , in the eyes of the law . Such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home , walk up to your door and hand you a package , completely ignorant about what is inside it . It 's hard to argue the UPS guy intentionally   possessed   your subscription to porno mags , in their nondescript brown packaging . That is the idea behind the   common carrier   exception to possession , and a large part of FedEx 's compelling legal argument . A   common carrier   is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation . The public policy reasons behind   common carrier   exemptions make sense ; the industry simply could n't function if every driver , courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of OxyContin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door . That would lead to an absurd result . That 's why the Controlled Substances Act and the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances , so long as it is in the usual course of their business . Of course , this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves   common carriers .   That 's why the   usual course of business   language acts as an additional safety measure . In court papers , FedEx 's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from Jamaica to Miami . This would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier , since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public , generally . On the other hand , FedEx argues that it is indeed a common carrier , performing the normal duties of a common carrier , because ( a ) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and ( b ) it offers its services to the public generally . It 's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband . Does this mean a Greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger ? The bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs . But if the guy boards the bus with a Grateful Dead T-shirt and a set of bongos , should n't the driver at least have a hunch ? That seems dangerously close to profiling . Is this another illogical straw man argument ? Maybe . Obviously , the Department of Justice disagrees , which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution . According to the indictment , from at least as early as 2004 , the Drug Enforcement Administration , the Food and Drug Administration , and members of Congress put FedEx on notice that illegal Internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the Controlled Substances Act , the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , and numerous state laws . The indictment alleges that as early as 2004 , FedEx knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts . FedEx 's couriers in Kentucky , Tennessee , and Virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to FedEx senior management . The DOJ is making the argument that even though FedEx carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public , FedEx knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity . It raises a larger question , though : Why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we ca n't even incarcerate ? The answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs , and drug smugglers smuggle them : Money . Power . The government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case , it would be to force FedEx to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation . The government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in   deferred prosecution agreements .   The reason you do n't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements ; for a company , a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence , whether or not it 's found guilty . Still , every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines . Do n't get me wrong : I 'm all about prosecuting the black market , especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with   V1AGRA   in the subject line , for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom . I want those guys locked up for sure . I 'm just not sure that FedEx has anything to do with the kingpins of the   FR33 CYALIS   email campaign . The DOJ 's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain . It makes good strategic sense . It might seem like good financial sense in the short run , with the millions in fines extracted from corporations , but that money has to come from somewhere . It 's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights . It probably does n't make good legal sense either . Yes , we have been treating corporations as fictional   persons   for centuries in some ways -- but it 's silly to treat them as persons in all ways . FedEx has a strong argument for dismissal in this case , but even if not , it wo n't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon .","reference":"justice department prosecuting fedex over unauthorized shipment of drugs .danny cevallos : fedex has a strong argument that it should n't be held responsible .","sent-rewriting":"the united states department of justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs . a 15-count indictment filed in federal court in california bristles with accusations of conspiracies . he says it 's a practice the supreme court has approved of for over a century . the company maintains that this case should never see a courtroom .","ctrl-dec-copy":"the united states department of justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs . the supreme court has approved of for over a century . the company maintains that it is innocent .","reinforced":"justice department has named a new defendant in the war on drugs. the courier delivery service. a a. of. would a fedex be held liable. the.

{"document":"This is the end . Beautiful friend , the end . For the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones ' Altamont fiasco in December 1969 , the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon 's 1972 re-election . For   Mad Men ,   the   end of an era ,   as its slogan has it , begins Sunday . Over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit . Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been   Mad Men   cocktails and   Mad Men   museum exhibits and even   Mad Men   presidential references . Don Draper , the creative director played by Jon Hamm , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours . Its subjects have taken the show to heart . In March , a   Mad Men   bench was unveiled in front of New York 's Time & Life Building , where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters . The end of a TV series brings with it some risk .   The Sopranos ,     Mad Men   creator Matthew Weiner 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale . On the other hand ,   Mad Men 's   former AMC stablemate ,   Breaking Bad ,   was saluted for an almost perfect landing . Speaking of landings : The last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969 . Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward . What 's going to happen ? Here are some educated guesses . With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion ,   Mad Men   probably wo n't jump ahead much . The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders , the Woodstock festival , a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with , if only tangentially . Who knows ? The show might even mention the Miracle Mets . It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency 's late Lane Pryce . Of course , Weiner might have a different idea ; he 's from Baltimore .   Mad Men   is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the '60s themselves . The old orders are falling apart : white-shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach ; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles ; the   Good War   generation butting heads with the   Make Love , Not War   cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid-state IBM world . It 's all an ad agency can do to keep up . Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill-fitting merger between Sterling Cooper and former rival Cutler Gleason and Chaough . Though the agency survived , it 's now without Bert Cooper ( Robert Morse ) and under the ownership of ( real-life ) Madison Avenue titan McCann Erickson . That 's not a recipe for long-term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- Ken Cosgrove ( Aaron Staton ) , Harry Crane ( Rich Sommer ) and perhaps even Joan Harris ( Christina Hendricks ) -- to look for an exit . Roger Sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by John Slattery -- might find an exit as well , but not one he 's anticipating . He 's suffered two heart attacks . He drinks to excess . He 's never grown up . Bet on a sudden and shocking departure . On the other hand , Peggy Olson 's star has continued to rise ( much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence ) . She left Sterling Cooper once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one . If Olson , played by Elisabeth Moss , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married . That is , if she 's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition . In recent seasons , Don 's ex-wife , Betty ( January Jones ) , has lost herself amid all the turmoil . She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses , and though husband Henry Francis ( Christopher Stanley ) has been far more supportive than Don , he 's a busy man . And Sally , Don 's daughter ( Kiernan Shipka ) , is proving to be a handful . On the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel . In recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother . You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock , or at least dropping out of school . Anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late-night rides with Glen Bishop -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ? Instead , try this : It 's April 1 , 1970 . Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series .

{"document":"Comedian Chris Rock made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue-in-cheek guide to not being beaten by the police . He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet :   This one was on film .   Now , he 's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks .   Stopped by the cops again wish me luck ,   he posted early Tuesday , along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background . He posted similar photos in February . Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason , calling it   driving while black .   Blacks are about 30 % more likely to be pulled over by police than whites , according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013 . And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , the issue is even more sensitive . Rock has n't commented on the tweets and did n't say how the police stop turned out . He got lots of support on Twitter .   My heart legit dropped , no kidding ,   one Twitter fan posted . Many praised him for documenting the stops . Some accused him of race-baiting . But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media . Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to   #Adapt   to avoid racial profiling .   I sold my $ 90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius 's , because I got tired of being pulled over by Police ,   Washington tweeted . Some saw that as a sell-out , saying Rock should n't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over .   Let me guess . . you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well ? .   Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted . Appearing on CNN , Washington defended the tweet , saying he wanted to   excite a conversation .   Years ago , Rock filmed a sketch for his   Chris Rock   show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man . Besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride . He did just that last year in a segment of   Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee   with Jerry Seinfeld . The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini . And what happened ? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas .   Here 's the crazy thing ,   Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo .

{"document":"Marseille , France   Investigators have collected all the main evidence from the site where Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed , a French national police official told CNN on Saturday . Investigators are not expected to return to the crash site , said Capt. Yves Naffrechoux of the High Mountain Gendarmerie . The plane crashed March 24 in rugged terrain of the Alps about 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) from the town of Seyne-les-Alpes .   All the police investigators have left the ( Germanwings ) crash site ,   he said .   There is only a private security company ensuring security around the crash site so that no one can go there .   The security firm will guard the site until the remaining debris is collected and taken to secure locations for further analysis , if necessary , he said . The flight data recorder , or   black box ,   was found Thursday by a member of the recovery team . The cockpit voice recorder was found days after the crash . In addition , out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site , lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles , said Brice Robin , Marseilles prosecutor . The crash killed all 150 people on board . Brice Robin , Marseilles prosecutor , said authorities have found 470 personnel effects at the site . That number includes 40 cell phones , though all those were badly damaged . Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones , given their condition . Authorities say the flight 's co-pilot , Andreas Lubitz , locked the captain out of the cockpit and engineered the plane 's demise . Initial tests on the flight data recorder show that Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane 's descent , according to the French air accident investigation agency , the BEA . It also has emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work .

{"document":"Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates   Lost luggage after a long flight is a common , frustrating occurrence of modern air travel . And sometimes , airlines lose things that are irreplaceable . American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City : her 2-year-old pet cat , Felix . Stewart said that she and her husband , Joseph Naaman , booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1 . Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening , Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport , according to Etihad Airways . Felix was able to get loose , Stewart said she believes , because the cat 's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area . Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat 's carrier had been crushed . Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat 's carrier . At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed . Nearly one week later , Felix remains missing .   For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo , not a live animal , makes me sick ,   Stewart said .   You trust that people care and are doing the job well , and then this happens .   A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is   extremely rare .   The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year . Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat . The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired   third-party specialists   to help in the hunt for Felix .   We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search ,   Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement .   We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident , as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority .   Stewart and her husband booked the cat 's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years . The couple said they spent $ 1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight .   You pay all of this money , but for what ? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of , but they 're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage ,   Stewart said . It is n't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York 's busiest airport . In August 2011 , a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco . That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport . But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost . This weekend , Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit , which provided a highly trained detection dog , to help track down Felix 's scent . A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix 's safe return , according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened , the Port Authority said . Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers .   We just want to find Felix . But I just do n't know if we will ,   she said .","reference":"couple spends $ 1,200 to ship their cat , felix , on a flight from the united arab emirates .felix went missing somewhere at john f. kennedy international airport , airline says .pets are   treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage ,   jennifer stewart says .","sent-rewriting":"jennifer stewart was devastated to learn that etihad airways lost her most important baggage . she and her husband joseph naaman booked on their flight from the united arab emirates . felix went missing on the grounds of kennedy airport . the cat 's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either .","ctrl-dec-copy":"american jennifer stewart says she was devastated to learn that etihad airways lost luggage . felix was able to get loose , stewart says , because the cat 's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area . felix remains missing after the plane arrived in new york that evening .","reinforced":"united states jennifer stewart says she was devastated to learn. etihad airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from abu dhabi to new york. her 0-year-old pet cat, felix. booked felix on their etihad airways flight from the united arab emirates to new york's john f. kennedy international airport on april 0. she says. the airline shipped more than 000 pets last year. etihad airways is investigating ground handlers. to. . the.

{"document":"Easter is unique on the Christian calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds Christmas . That 's in part because Easter is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives . Nevertheless , I 'm often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the Christian tradition , actually know about what is called Holy Week and its culmination on Easter Sunday . At a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics ( and tolerance ) that have profound religious implications , it 's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders . After all , Holy Week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent . Still , the fuss must puzzle those looking on , wondering what it all means . Why do Christians make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of Easter weekend ? There is a phrase that many never come across , even among Christians : Easter Triduum . This refers to the three days of Easter that begin with Good Friday , proceed through Holy Saturday , and conclude with Easter Sunday . It 's definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer . Easter Triduum has a kind of major prologue in Maundy Thursday , the day when , by tradition , Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem on the night before he was crucified . The idea of Holy Communion begins with this meal , which was a Passover meal . Jesus , of course , was Jewish , as were all his disciples . He was never trying to erase Judaism and found a new religion . His work involved modifying and extending Judaism in fresh ways . On Maundy Thursday , Christians sometimes practice the washing of feet , recalling that Jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the Last Supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior . Good Friday is n't , in fact , so good . It 's the day of the crucifixion , when Jesus was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to Golgotha , the   place of the skull ,   and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death . The actual scene of the Crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel , as do his last words , assembled into the so-called   seven last words   of Jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels . Some of these words are quotations , as when Jesus asked God why he has abandoned him : This is a quote from the 22nd Psalm , which opens :   My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?   Good Friday is a day of death , sacrifice , displacement , fear . Holy Saturday is probably the least understood day of the Easter Triduum . It 's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of Easter . This day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n't quite erased -- ca n't be erased -- simply by hope . It 's a day of depression , a day of suspension . Then comes Easter , with the aura of the resurrection . I 'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment , when the body of Christ becomes what is called a   glorified body .   This was not , as I 've said elsewhere , the Great Resuscitation , although that 's part of it , too . Resurrection implies a total transformation , something beyond the physical realm . It 's very important that almost nobody who encounters Jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him , know him , or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified . Easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding . The three days of Easter , the Triduum , occur only once a year on the calendar . But the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again . We find ourselves emptied out in small ways , nailed to our own trees in life , embarrassed or broken by life . It was the Buddha who famously observed that life is suffering . Good Friday embodies the Christian version of that truth . Jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer . We must all die , perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly . Our friends and families must die . We all experience illness , loss , sadness , a loss of confidence , darkness . This is simply part of the human experience . We dive again and again into Holy Saturday , too -- a period of transition , when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view . We know well this in-between time ; it 's an anxious passage , with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope . And we 've all been resurrected , again and again , perhaps in tiny ways . This is the joy of Easter , and it 's not something reserved for one day on the calendar . It 's there whenever we experience what T.S. Eliot once called the   timeless moment ,   which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself . It 's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time . I suspect we all experience the Triduum frequently , sometimes more than once in a single day . But the ritual enactment of these three days of the Easter season reminds all of those who practice Christianity -- and perhaps those who do n't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light . It 's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression . It 's good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n't easily be co-opted by secular culture .","reference":"jay parini : when religious identity , ethics , tolerance are roiling the culture ,

{"document":"Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me ,   Jesus tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables . It was a mantra he invoked repeatedly : the poor were blessed , and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise . Meanwhile , Jesus told his Twelve Apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support . So how did this wandering band of first-century evangelists support themselves ? Clearly , money was a concern , and not just as an impediment to salvation . In the New Testament , money gets 37 mentions , while   gold   gets 38 citations ,   silver   merits 20 , and   copper   four .   Coin   comes up eight times , and   purse   and   denarii   -- the Roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals . Perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the New Testament : . As the Gospel of John tells it , six days before Passover , Jesus was in Bethany at the house of his friend Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead . A woman named Mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining Jesus . She dries his feet with her hair , an irresistible image for artists and dramatists . Judas Iscariot objected to the act .   Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor ?   Judas asks . Though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer , Jesus told Judas to leave her alone , and foreshadowing his fate , said the anointing would be useful for his burial , and besides ,   you always have the poor with you   -- but Jesus would not always be there . What that passage makes clear is that the Jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive . So how much ?   I imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level ,   Rabbi Joshua Garroway , a professor of Early Christianity and the Second Commonwealth at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles . Jesus and his disciples walked , wore what they had , slept outside or in stayed in friends ' homes . They ate what they caught or what others shared .   I venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of Jesus and the companions with whom he traveled ,   Garroway said . Garroway said that it was possible , even likely , that Jesus and his followers received donations from supporters , and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth . The Gospel of Luke gives us a glimpse of how Jesus ' ministry functioned on a practical level : .   Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God . The twelve were with him , as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out , and Joanna , the wife of Herod 's steward Chuza , and Susanna , and many others , who provided for them out of their resources .   So , according to Luke , women whom Jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their   resources ,   with Mary Magdalene and Joanna capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband , and the other , by her stature in the story of Jesus . Joanna was an upper-class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of Herod Antipas , the son of Herod the Great , the violent and ambitious head of Judea . As part of this volatile but powerful household , Joanna would be uniquely positioned to help Jesus with her resources , being both wealthy and having palace connections . She attends to him during his life , and , the Gospels tell us , after his death , as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty . With her on that morning is Mary Magdalene , also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of Jesus . Mary likely came from the prosperous town of Magdala , on the Sea of Galilee . As home to a thriving fishing industry , as well as dye and textile works , Mary could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself . Mary Magdalene was free to travel the country with Jesus and his disciples , so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home , and in   Finding Jesus   we examine the Gnostic gospel of Mary Magdalene and explore the argument that Jesus was , in fact , her husband . She may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message , and messenger . Not only was Mary Magdalene one of Jesus ' most devoted followers , who stuck with him all the way from Galilee to Jerusalem , from the ministry to the cross and the tomb , but also she provided for him from her own means , said Mark Goodacre , a professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Duke University . When the Gospels speak of her   ministering   to Jesus , they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in Jesus ' everyday mission , Goodacre continues . Along with other women like Joanna and Susanna , she was one of those who made his mission viable . Along with these women , men like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus , both men of stature and wealth , may have chipped in to help fund Jesus ' ministry . The Gospels reveal that both these men were rich , and supported Jesus -- indeed , it was Joseph who removed Jesus from the cross on Good Friday , anointing his body with the help of Nicodemus , and placing him in the tomb that Joseph had reserved for himself . After the resurrection on that first Easter Sunday , the movement Jesus started grew exponentially , and the church 's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater .

Forgery. : Six Holy Objects That Tell the Remarkable Story of the Gospels .","reference":"some of jesus ' most important financial backers were women , historians say .joseph of arimathea and

{"document":"The nation 's top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country . Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev . Both lengthy trials are coming to a close . In Louisville , Kentucky , Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president , while in Chicago , voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus   Chuy   Garcia . And in Ferguson , Missouri , the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city 's elections . Here 's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here : . Tsarnaev , who 's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother , faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he 's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism . The 13th juror : What defense ? On Monday , survivors and victims ' families wept and Tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old   brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets .   The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges , before the so-called penalty phase , should he be found guilty on any counts . It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd , yet on Monday , Hernandez 's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day . Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday , and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter . Jurors in Fall River , Massachusetts , will be asked to decide if Hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of Lloyd , whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013 . Much of the evidence against Hernandez is circumstantial , and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft 's testimony , the testimony of Hernandez 's fiancee , some grainy footage from Hernandez 's home security system and a footprint left by a Nike Air Jordan shoe . Hernandez known for swagger , even in court . OK , sure , no one was floored when the Kentucky senator announced his bid for the Oval Office , but of course it was news when he made it official Tuesday . Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire , South Carolina , Iowa and Nevada . The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010 , where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism , and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House . Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination , though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida 's Jeb Bush , New Jersey 's Chris Christie , Wisconsin 's Scott Walker , South Carolina 's Lindsey Graham and Florida 's Marco Rubio . Would Rand be here without Ron ? It 's the Windy City 's first runoff for a citywide office , and it 's being billed as a battle for the   future of Chicago .   In one corner , you have Emanuel , President Barack Obama 's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff , and in the other , you have Jesus   Chuy   Garcia , a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats ' frustrations with the Chicago incumbent . After Emanuel failed to snare half the vote in February 's general election , he will go head-to-head with Garcia . The timing is interesting , too , as Easter , Passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes , up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in February . Following Michael Brown 's death , the national spotlight shone on Ferguson , particularly how the city 's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council . Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership , only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots . Residents speak out ahead of vote . Tuesday 's election will bring change , no matter how the ballots are cast : Two black men are running for one of the open seats , and the current lone black council member is n't up for re-election . In another ward , two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat . And a white protester is running for a third post .","reference":"the trials of dzhokhar tsarnaev and aaron hernandez are coming to a close .voting has put rahm emanuel and ferguson , missouri , back

{"document":"Cedar Falls , Iowa   As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , on Thursday , the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him . Finally , after the selfies and conversations started to die down , his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall , burly man stopped him .   Senator ,   he said ,   can I pray with you real quick ?     Yeah ,   Cruz said , as he clasped the man 's upper arm and the two bowed their heads . It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week , as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate . Being the only official contender in the race , Cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state . He 's counting on Iowa , known for its vocal and active evangelical base , to propel him forward in what 's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates . Cruz , himself , displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room . The senator regularly avoids using a podium , instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone , a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon . When he meets with people after events , he embraces each one 's hand with both of his , softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing Christians and their pastors . The past two winners of Iowa 's caucuses rose to victory with support from the Christian right , and Cruz , who announced his bid last month at the well-known Baptist school Liberty University , is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize . Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa 's Republican voter bloc . According to a Des Moines Register\/Bloomberg Politics poll from January , 44 % of likely 2016 Republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical Christians . Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues , but he showed in Iowa last week that he 's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them . He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in Indiana , which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians . He described the outrage over the laws as   shameful   and an   assault   on First Amendment rights .   There are a lot of people here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking , watching what has happened in the last two weeks ,   Cruz said Friday night at an event in Des Moines .   We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty .   RELATED : Republican 2016 hopefuls back Indiana 's ` religious freedom ' law . He 's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a Christian and a pastor . Rafael Cruz , who 's become a celebrity among Christian conservatives , will frequently visit Iowa over the next year , Cruz told voters . And Cruz 's Iowa director , Bryan English , is a former pastor . Cruz 's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday . In the ad , Cruz talks about the impact of the   transformative love of Jesus Christ   on his life . While neither Mike Huckabee , who won Iowa in 2008 , nor Rick Santorum , who won in 2012 , went on to win the nomination , their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners . And with both of them likely running again in 2016 , the competition will be stiff . That 's why , for Cruz , courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base . His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction . He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS , and , in a knock against the National Security Agency , he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama   can hear every word I have to say .   Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the Santorum base -- evangelicals . The two blocs , he said , are   not necessarily the best of chums .     If we 're going to win , we 've got to bring that coalition together ,   he said in Cedar Falls .   And I think we can do that .   Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels , when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election , a higher than normal turnout for the demographic . That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it 's not too far off from the 56 % of the overall population that voted in 2012 . Still , his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who 've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform , then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls .   If you look at available places for the party to expand the vote , it does n't exist in the middle , it exists in the evangelical vote ,   said Rick Tyler , a top Cruz adviser .   It is n't a pond , it 's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative .   Russell Moore , president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention , said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says . Moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the U.S. , as well as increased attention to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East and rising anti-Semitism .   I do n't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith ,   Moore said .   I think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good .   Later in April , voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition . While the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses -- Santorum and Huckabee -- are likely running for president again , Steve Scheffler , president of the group , argued that the field is wide open in terms of who 's going to win favor among evangelicals . Jeb Bush , while not popular among conservative activists , was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as Florida governor and touts his Catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views . Scott Walker is the son of a pastor . Ben Carson , the former neurosurgeon , rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the Obama administration at a national prayer breakfast . And other likely candidates -- from Marco Rubio to Rick Perry to Rand Paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right .   It 's up for grabs . It 's a clean slate regardless of if you 've run before ,   Scheffler said .   Naturally those two ( Huckabee and Santorum ) have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past , but by and large voters are going to say , ` Let me take a good look at all of these candidates .

Zhou Yongkang , 72 , was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets , the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , the highest prosecution authority in China , said . As a member of the ruling Communist Party 's Politburo Standing Committee -- China 's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people . He retired in 2012 . At the height of his power , Zhou controlled police forces , spy agencies , court systems as well as prosecution offices across China -- and was n't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of   preserving social stability .   Now , prosecutors have accused Zhou of   taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money   during his long political career . His alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests , they added . Zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer 's views were heard , according to a statement by the prosecutors . His case will be tried in Tianjin , a city near the Chinese capital , Beijing . The president of China 's supreme court recently told reporters there would be   open   trials for accused former leaders like Zhou . However , the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in Zhou 's case . Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013 . He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December . State media have painted an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer . Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth , in a blatant exchange between money and power . He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex , state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year . Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics , now ruled by President Xi Jinping . Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign , targeting both   tigers   and   flies   -- high-ranking , and low-level , officials . Zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in Xi 's dragnet to date .   The important thing here is that Xi has proven he 's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members ,   longtime political analyst Willy Lam , a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , said last year , when the government revealed its formal investigation into Zhou . Many observers also note Zhou 's patronage of Bo Xilai , a former Communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013 . Bo 's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder , bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention . State media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of Xi 's resolve to clean up the party . The former Chongqing Communist Party chief 's supporters , however , have long called him a political victim -- the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi 's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership . Political watchers see similarities between the Bo and Zhou cases .   The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles ,   said Lam , who has predicted a suspended death sentence for Zhou .","reference":"prosecutors formally

{"document":"Boston   Guilty across the board . But will he face death ? After deliberating for 11 1\/2 hours , jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial . Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges , meaning he is eligible for the death penalty . The trial will next move into a penalty phase , where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev , 21 , will be executed . A look at all of the charges . Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history , as well as his relative youth . Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing . The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set . Since testimony began March 4 , federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses , and the defense just four . It seemed a mismatch from the start .   He was there ,   Tsarnaev 's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened , but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev 's life . Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row . Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client 's older brother , 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev , who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack , was the instigator of the marathon plot . The younger man , Clarke said , was only following his older brother . After the verdict , CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle .   Because No. 1 , he ( Tsarnaev ) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he 's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians .   And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die , so that children would be maimed . And all of this , she has to get around and convince the jury he 's not worthy of the death penalty .   Boy , she 's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case ,   Callan said about Clarke . Survivors react to the verdict . Ann O'Neill reported from Boston . Dana Ford reported from Atlanta .","reference":"dzhokhar tsarnaev is found guilty on all 30 charges he faced .seventeen counts were capital charges , meaning he is eligible for the death penalty

{"document":"Do you remember the talk about plans for Iraqi-led force to try to take back Mosul this spring ? Well , you might want to forget it . Nearly three months after a U.S. official said up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May , a senior official in President Barack Obama 's administration said Thursday that Washington is   not putting a timeframe on   a possible invasion . It   might be some time from now . Might be soon ,   another senior administration official said . Mosul has long been the big prize in the Iraqi government 's fight -- aided by a U.S.-led military coalition , which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat ISIS . It has also long been a source of embarrassment , considering how it fell after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons , abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last June . The senior administration officials who talked to reporters Thursday stressed the Iraqis and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the Islamic State . In fact , officials insist that ISIS has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat . The biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture a few weeks ago of Tikrit , the hometown of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein that is located some 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) north of Baghdad . Iraqi forces aided by Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen took that northern city , the same place where ISIS allegedly massacred Iraqi troops last year . Still , Mosul is n't Tikrit . For one thing , it has a lot more people -- about a million , one Obama administration official noted . And it 's more important not only to Iraq , but ISIS , meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all-out to defend it . In some ways , the campaign for Mosul has begun , according to officials . There are no plans for U.S. combat troops involvement in an eventual operation , they say , but airstrikes have already targeted ISIS positions in the area . Just because the area has been softened up some from the air , though , does n't mean a full ground assault is imminent . Calling for   patience ,   an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor . It will   take a lot of capacity ,   the official said ,   and some time to build .","reference":"u.s. official said in february that iraqi troops could go into mosul in april or may .officials say

{"document":"The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $ 1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system , including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010 . Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety . Of the $ 1.6 billion , $ 850 million will go to   gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements ,   the commission said . Another $ 50 million will go toward   other remedies to enhance pipeline safety ,   according to the commission .

The company 's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States .   Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno , we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims , their families and the community of San Bruno ,   Tony Earley said .   We are deeply sorry for this tragic event , and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve . The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten .   On September 9 , 2010 , a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno , killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others . The blast destroyed 37 homes . PG&E said it has paid more than $ 500 million in claims to the victims and victims ' families in San Bruno , which is just south of San Francisco . The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe , installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board . According to its website , PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers .

{"document":"In her 40 years living in Rochelle , Illinois , Cathy Olson had never seen a tornado that big .   I saw the top of the funnel cloud , and it was absolutely massive ,   she said . She watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday , tearing up its fringes . Farther north , in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale , one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs . Only the thickest branches remained standing . It was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns . Rochelle was fortunate . But in nearby Kirkland , debris was so thick on the roads , responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries , fire officials said . On Thursday , a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field , barely missing farmhouses and barns . Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media . Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday . A large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa . And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis . Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma , Kansas and Missouri , the Storm Prediction Center said . But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive . Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton , Illinois . It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state 's third largest city . The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County , according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter . North of Rochelle , a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers .   It 's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants ,   said Eric Widick , who drove up in his truck to help out .   We 're a community . If one person is in need , we 'll all be there for them .   People were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside . No one was killed or seriously injured , Widick said . Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour . People had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it , Widick said . In Rochelle , the tornado flattened some of Olson 's friends ' homes . A safe distance away from it , at her mother 's house , she had to think about her husband , Chet , who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before . He 'd have a job ahead of him .   I have not been able to get a hold of him , Olson said ,   but I know he 's in touch with the sheriff and is safe ,   she said . Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable . The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own . Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage , he said . Only foundations remained of some homes , said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk .   You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be ,   he said . Lindsey Clark , a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX , said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area . VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday . On Thursday , the storm took his house and his sister-in-law 's .   I 've got the clothes on my back ,   he said . But his family was n't at home when it hit .   My family was on the way to Louisville , dog was in the basement and she survived .   It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county .   I 've lived here all my life , am the fifth generation in the county . My mom said this is the first time she 's ever seen a tornado .   He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come . That saved lives , he believes . The service warned of a   particularly dangerous situation .   People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather . Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday .

{"document":"Eyewitness video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene . Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott . A bystander 's cell phone video , which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott , shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away . Scott was hit five times . If words were exchanged between the men , they 're are not audible on the tape . It 's unclear what happened before Scott ran , or why he ran . The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott , who , Slager said , tried to take the weapon . Before Slager opens fire , the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground . It 's unclear whether that is the Taser . Later in the video , when Slager approaches Scott 's body , Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott . Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting . Witness : I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . Feidin Santana , the witness who recorded the video , said he did n't see Scott grab Slager 's Taser . His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers . In two interviews with NBC , Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott , who had been pulled over for a broken taillight . Santana told NBC 's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground .   They were down on the ( ground ) ... before I started recording ,   Santana said .   I remember the police ( officer ) had control of the situation . He had control of Scott .   Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used . He believed Scott was trying to get away from it . But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer , Santana told NBC . Who was Walter Scott ? A North Charleston Police report included brief statements from eight police officers , but not Slager . One officer , identified as Sgt. J. Gann , said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. Saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- Slager say he was   in foot pursuit   of another motorist . Gann said that while driving to the officer 's location ,   Slager advised that he deployed his Taser and ( requested ) back up units .   Seconds later , Gann reported , he heard Slager tell a dispatcher ,   Shots fired and the subject is down . He took my Taser .   Hours after the shooting , The Post and Courier of Charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman Spencer Pryor , who said Slager attempted to use his Taser to stop a fleeing suspect . The men struggled over the device , with the suspect taking the Taser and attempting to use it against Slager , the newspaper reported . In the police report , another officer , J. Banias , said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call . Slager asked him to   secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop .   Banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car Scott was driving .   The passenger was ... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle ,   the officer reported . The passenger 's identity was not given in the report , but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained . Scott family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed to CNN that a man was with Scott and said he is not related to the family . The family declined to provide any more information . A timeline of events . The North Charleston Police Department is not providing additional information , citing an ongoing investigation of Scott 's killing by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division . Gann said when he arrived at the shooting scene , an officer identified only as Habersham   was administering first aid   to Scott .   I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Habersham with first aid and CPR to the driver ,   Gann said in the report .   We continued to perform first aid and CPR until EMS arrived ... When EMS and first responders arrived , EMS took care over providing care to the driver , who was pronounced deceased a short time later .   Habersham , in his account , did not mention performing CPR .   I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and ( directing ) the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster ,   he said in the report . An officer identified as Sgt. Webb said that he requested an ambulance . Webb said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw Habersham   administering chest compression to the defendant .   North Charleston Police Chief Eddie Driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether CPR was performed on Scott .   I do not know . I was told that life-saving ... that they tried to save his life ,   Driggers said . North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey added that not every North Charleston police officer is CPR certified .

{"document":"Police in India are putting aside their batons in favor of an overhead solution to angry and unruly crowds : pepper-spraying drones . Yashasvi Yadav , Senior Superintendent of police in Lucknow , northern India , told CNN the city 's force has bought four drones and is in the process of purchasing one more .   The drones have been tested in controlled conditions ,   he said .   They have been very successful and will be used by the Lucknow police whenever there are violent protests or mob attacks .   The miniature aircraft will be fitted with a camera and pepper spray ; each drone costs between $ 9,560 and $ 19,300 , Yadav added . Views on the new measure are mixed , with some concerned about the suppression of freedom of speech -- an already contentious issue in India . Last month , the country failed to enforce a law that would allow authorities to arrest people who post offensive material on social media . Others believe the country could learn from events further afield . Some say this method of crowd control needs regulation too . Questions have also been raised as to why the police are resorting to aggression .   While I think it is bound to fail if not be another scam in the making , it also shows the mindset of the administration to not use dialogue and mediation to solve problems but use authoritarian and forceful methods ,   photojournalist Chirag Wakaskar in Mumbai told CNN .   What they could do is start by having video surveillance in sensitive areas and have swifter justice .   Protests are a common occurrence in India , a country with a population of 1.2 billion ; Lucknow , the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh , also used drone cameras to monitor crowds at a recent religious festival . As well as being used as a security measure in other cities including Delhi and Mumbai , the unmanned , airborne vehicles have been used in tiger hunts , disaster relief and criminal investigations -- and even pizza deliveries . Reports suggest that the drone surveillance will be officially launched by the Chief Minister of Lucknow , Akhilesh Yadav , later this month .

{"document":"Just as the agency begins to recover from a series of high-profile missteps , the Secret Service is facing yet another scandal . A female employee accused Xavier Morales , a supervisor within the agency , of assault after he made sexual advances at her , according to The Washington Post .   The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales , her boss , told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her ,   and later tried to kiss her in the office , according to a report from The Washington Post . During the incident , he   grabbed her arms when she resisted   and the two tussled until Morales gave up , sources told the paper . The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales ' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office . A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended . This incident was first reported on April 2 , and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon . Clancy called the allegations   very disturbing .     Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated ,   he said in a statement . This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months . Last month , two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb . Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later . The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn . Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House . Earlier in September , an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta . An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched   beyond its limits ,   needing more training , more staff , and a director from outside its ranks . Clancy , who formally assumed the post in February , is a 27-year veteran of the agency .   It 's going to take time to change some of this culture ,   Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month .   There 's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain . That 's going to take time because I 'm going to have to build trust with our workforce .   The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General .","reference":"secret service says supervisor 's security clearance has been suspended .he is accused of trying to

{"document":"( The Hollywood Reporter ) Richard Dysart , the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick , long-running NBC drama   L.A. Law ,   has died . He was 86 . Dysart , who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller 's Pulitzer Prize-winning   That Championship Season ,   died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness , his wife , artist Kathryn Jacobi , told The Hollywood Reporter . The acclaimed   L.A. Law   -- created by Steven Bochco ( who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley ) and Terry Louise Fisher -- aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994 . For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie , Brackman , Chaney and Kuzak , Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years , finally winning the trophy in 1992 .   I always had him in mind for that role ,   Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television .   He 's so avuncular . So I reached out to him . You know , Dick is sort of an old hippie . So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit , and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie . He was perfect .     We got together , mapped out the character 's past to give us a basis from which to work , and it 's all gone smoothly since then ,   Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times .   Sometimes I worry -- it 's all been going too well -- a role I love to play in a series that 's about as good as you can get . Something 's wrong !   Perhaps Dysart 's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays ( played by Diana Muldaur ) . He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode . Dysart 's range of authority - figure parts ran right to the top . He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm   Day One   and in the ABC miniseries   War and Remembrance ,   both of which aired in 1989 , and he was Henry L. Stimson , the 33rd U.S. president 's Secretary of War , in the 1995 HBO telefilm   Truman ,   starring Gary Sinise . Similarly , he played the Secretary of Defense in   Meteor   ( 1979 ) . Hollywood Reporter : Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical - ( movie ) field , performing enough doctor roles to , perhaps , qualify to practice . His two most memorable came in classic satires : in Paddy Chayevsky 's scathing   The Hospital   ( 1971 ) , starring George C. Scott ( a good friend ) , and in   Being There   ( 1979 ) , as Melvyn Douglas ' doctor . He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter 's   The Thing   ( 1982 ) and a physician in such films as   The Terminal Man   ( 1974 ) ,   The Falcon and the Snowman   ( 1985 ) and   Warning Sign   ( 1985 ) . Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm   Marilyn & Bobby : Her Final Affair   and in Mario Van Peebles '   Panther   ( 1995 ) . Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts . He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester 's   Petulia   ( 1968 ) ; was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in   Pale Rider   ( 1985 ) ; stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone 's   Wall Street   ( 1987 ) ; and sold barbwire in   Back to the Future III   ( 1990 ) . Dysart was born March 30 , 1929 , in Boston and raised in Maine . Following high school , he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel , Maine , for a year , served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College , where he graduated with a master 's degree in speech communications . At the time , he was interested in a career in radio ( he became fascinated with the medium in first grade , when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever ) but was soon tempted by acting . He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of   The Iceman Cometh   opposite Jason Robards . In the mid-1960s , he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays , then landed roles on Broadway in   All in Good Time ,     The Little Foxes   and   A Place Without Doors .   He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in   That Championship Season .   Hollywood Reporter : Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart 's credits include an eclectic array of movies , including   The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder   ( 1974 ) ,   The Day of the Locust   ( 1975 ) ,   The Hindenburg   ( 1975 ) ,   An Enemy of the People   ( 1978 ) ,   Prophecy   ( 1979 ) ,   Mask   ( 1985 ) and   Hard Rain   ( 1998 ) . On television , he was top-notch in the telefilms   The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman   ( 1974 ) ,   The People vs. Jean Harris   ( 1981 ) , as Dwight D. Eisenhower in   The Last Days of Patton   ( 1986 ) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in   Malice in Wonderland   ( 1985 ) . Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi , mother-in-law Lenore , brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi . A private memorial is being planned . In lieu of flowers , the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum , an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area . Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia . He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance , the   L.A. Law   reunion telefilm of 2002 .   They remain timely , with cases about points of law that are still current ,   he said of watching   L.A. Law   reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News .   -LSB- The show -RSB- was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom . It was very much of the times , and very Los Angeles . It holds up as well as any series I know .   People we 've lost in 2015 . \u00a9 2015 The Hollywood Reporter .

{"document":"You may know Mindy Kaling from Fox 's cult hit comedy   The Mindy Project ,   in which she plays Mindy Lahiri , a perky , quirky OB\/GYN juggling her career and love life in New York . ( Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment ! ) . The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation -- the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color -- and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season . Recently , however , Kaling 's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own , and while it has been getting a lot of attention , it has n't generated quite as many laughs -- either from observers or from his famous sibling , who told him it brought   shame upon their family .   You see , Chokalingam revealed that , as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago , he engaged in a daring ( his view ) or ridiculous and offensive ( pretty much everyone else ) scam : He applied to medical school claiming to be African-American . Chokalingam had spent his college years as a   hard-partying frat boy ,   and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA . Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options , he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice -- but that   black , Hispanic , and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance .   This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man , both to   dramatically improve   his chances of admission , and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools . To accomplish this goal , Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks , trimmed his   long Indian-American eyelashes ,   checked   black   under the optional race\/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname   JoJo .   He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools , results that he claims support the notion that African-Americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or Asians . And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired , he 's looking to write a book on his experiences , titled   Almost Black : The True Story of an Indian American Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African American .   What 's truly curious is that even if you agree with Chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of   systematic racism ,   when all is said and done , it offers very little evidence of the   privilege   that he claims is accorded to black , Hispanic and Native American candidates . Chokalingam had mediocre grades and MCATs , but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation . Yet even while representing himself as black , Chokalingam received only a single admission offer , to St. Louis University 's School of Medicine , which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings . Harvard , University of Pennsylvania , Columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him . Meanwhile , he admits , pretending to be black came with disadvantages . He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops -- who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost , implying that he must have stolen it . These acts of very real prejudice , experienced regularly by blacks and Hispanics of all backgrounds -- multimillionaire comedian Chris Rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason -- did n't seem to dissuade Chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making . It 's not just a matter of what individual applicants   deserve .   One-third of Americans are black , Hispanic or Native American ; just one in 10 physicians are . Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities , this lack of diversity has produced   doctor deserts ,   in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians . Years ago , when I told my father -- a doctor from a long line of doctors -- that I did n't want to follow in his footsteps , he told me that was fine , because medicine is a service trade , and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession . A medical degree is n't a reward to be earned , he said , but a responsibility to be accepted . Which really cuts to the heart of what 's so sad about Chokalingam 's racial farce . Like others who 've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities -- including putative presidential candidate Jeb Bush , who registered himself as   Hispanic   on a 2009 voter form , and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed Native American ancestry in the past -- Chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people 's burden . Race is n't just about color or blood ; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people . Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive ; others are deeply painful . Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation 's history ; an imperfect one , but necessary . There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own . Industries like health care and Hollywood . Because what 's most ironic about Chokalingam 's decision to ride on his sister 's coattails in telling his story : While Asians are well represented in medicine , our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world , and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like Mindy Kaling , it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces , voices and stories . Kaling 's immense talent and charisma made her a star . But it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- NBC 's Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start .","reference":"mindy kaling 's brother vijay chokalingam pretended to be black to

{"document":"A long , long , time ago ...   Those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean 's pop masterpiece   American Pie .   It 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1\/2 minute allegory , which millions of Americans know by heart , is 44 years old . All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as   Bye , Bye , Miss American Pie .   There is no real way to categorize McLean 's   American Pie   for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . On Tuesday , Christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . McLean was a paperboy when , on February 3 , 1959 , he saw that Buddy Holly , Ritchie Valens and J.P.   The Big Bopper   Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake , Iowa .   The next day I went to school in shock and guess what ?   McLean recalled .   Nobody cared . Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 .   By cathartically writing   American Pie ,   McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . Having recorded his first album ,   Tapestry ,   in 1969 , in Berkeley , California , during the student riots , McLean , a native New Yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the   generation lost in space .   When his cultural anthem   American Pie   was released in November 1971 , it replaced Bob Dylan 's   The Times They Are A Changin   as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade . It 's important to think of   American Pie   as one would of Henry Longfellow 's   Evangeline   or Johnny Mercer 's   Moon River   -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . There is magic brewing in the music and words of   American Pie ,   for McLean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel   On the Road .   Don McLean : Buddy Holly , rest in peace . Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers , McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when   American Pie   topped the Billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . Wandering far and wide , singing   American Pie   at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England , at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley , McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing   and they were singing   everybody spontaneously joins in with the   Bye , Bye   chorus . Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening . What makes   American Pie   so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . When   American Pie   suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . Like   Danny Boy   or   Streets of Laredo   or   Shenandoah ,   it 's eternal . With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . After all these years ,   American Pie   still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . The song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . It is a song that will never die . A reverie for the ages . There is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional Irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . While McLean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret   American Pie ,   it 's fair to surmise that   the king   is Elvis Presley ,   Helter Skelter   refers to the Charles Manson murders , the   jester on the sidelines in a cast   is Bob Dylan , and   Jack Flash   the Rolling Stones . But who knows ? The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . As a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to   American Pie .   Normally , I do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose   American Pie   as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . The other four were   Over the Rainbow   ( by Harold Arlen and E.Y   Yip   Harburg ) ,   White Christmas   ( by Irving Berlin ) ,   This Land is Your Land   ( by Woody Guthrie ) and   Respect   ( by Otis Redding ) . That is fine company . Quite simply ,   American Pie   is one of the greatest songs ever written .

{"document":"Anthony Ray Hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on Alabama 's death row for murders he says he did n't commit . And incredulous that it took so long . Hinton , 58 , looked up , took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham , minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985 . He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life , under fear of execution , for something he did n't do .   All they had to do was to test the gun , but when you think you 're high and mighty and you 're above the law , you do n't have to answer to nobody ,   Hinton told reporters .   But I 've got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row , you will answer to God .   Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state 's motion to dismiss charges against him . Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area , fast-food restaurant managers , John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason . But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case , and the two killings could n't be linked to each other .   Death Row Stories   : Hard questions about the U.S. capital punishment system . The state then declined to re-prosecute the case . Hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence , said the Equal Justice Initiative , a group that helped win his release .   Race , poverty , inadequate legal assistance , and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice ,   Bryan Stevenson , the group 's executive director and Hinton 's lead attorney , said of his African-American client .   I ca n't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton .   Stevenson said the   refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling .   Amnesty report : Executions down but death sentences on the rise . Dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt , Hinton praised God for his release , saying he was sent   not just a lawyer , but the best lawyers .   He said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims . Both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice , he said .   For all of us that say that we believe in justice , this is the case to start showing , because I should n't have ( sat ) on death row for 30 years ,   he said . Woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters , one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area . Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon , Stevenson said . His mother , with whom he lived at the time of his arrest , is no longer living , according to the lawyer . Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend . He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs , such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup , Stevenson said . The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and   sort out what he wants to do ,   Stevenson said .","reference":"anthony ray hinton goes free friday , decades after conviction for two murders .court ordered new trial in 2014 , years after gun experts testified on his behalf .prosecution moved to dismiss charges this year .","sent-rewriting":"anthony ray hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 30 years on death row . hinton , 58 , took in the sunshine and thanked god and his lawyers friday morning . hinton was convicted of murder in 1985 deaths of two birmingham-area , john davidson and thomas wayne vason . new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier .","ctrl-dec-copy":"anthony ray hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two birmingham-area . he was 29 at the time of the killings , but a new trial was ordered in 2014 . the revolver hinton was said to have used in the crimes could n't be linked to each other .","reinforced":"anthony ray hinton is thankful to be free after nearly 00 years on alabama's death row for murders. anthony ray hinton says he didn't commit. god and his lawyers. anthony ray hinton was convicted of murder in the 0000 murders of two birmingham-area. , fast-food restaurant managers. . the.
